Okay, let's revise the dictionary entry for `SI`. The goal is to ensure its definition clearly encompasses the broader sense of "governing principle/law" alongside "measure/standard," particularly to support its role in `sipu`.

Here's the revised entry:

# SI

IPA:				/ˈsi/
Marker::		**Numeral marker**
Concept::		**Rule, Law, Principle; Standard, Measure, Unit**
Action::		**To measure, quantify; To regulate (by rule), apply principles; To standardize**
Descriptor::	**Exact, Measured; Principled, Regulated**

> Represents systems of regulation, measurement, and underlying order. This includes not just quantifiable standards (`measure`, `unit`) but also the fundamental **principles, laws (natural or societal), or governing guidelines** (`rule`, `law`, `principle`) that structure behavior and interactions. It forms a core component of `[[sipu]]` (system = rule-based structure). Primary use is as a marker for numerals; other uses often require clarification (e.g., with `le` or `ta`).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Marks explicit numerical context to resolve ambiguity.

Example::   *A hat `si` a neko.* = "I have **one** cat." (vs. *A hat a neko* = "I have my cat.")

Example::   *Tama o `si` heim.* = "The road is **four**."

Example::   *E o `si` an ku?* = "Are you **two**?"

> More examples in Numerical context clarification

### Concept
*   A system of quantification (length, time, mass), agreed norms, a fundamental truth, or a governing guideline. Often requires `le`.

Example::   *Le `si` ro mapi o sun.* = "The **principles/laws** (governing) the planets are known/clear."

Example::   *Ouman ta le `si` ro maheim.* = "Sentient beings follow **the laws/principles** of the homeland."

Example::   *Pene o le `si`.* = "Goodness is the **principle/standard**."

### Action
*   To assess value against a scale, regulate according to a system, or apply underlying principles. Often requires `ta`.

Example::   *A `ta si` neko.* = "I **measure** the cat." (Quantify)

Example::   *Timo `ta si` ouman.* = "Time **governs/regulates** humanity." (Applies principle/law)

Example::   *An `ta si` ne sun se.* = "We **apply the principle** based on that knowledge."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as conforming to a measurement, rule, or principle. Often requires `so`.

Example::   *Pu `so si` o mo.* = "The **regulated/measured** structure is big."

Example::   *Ta `so si` o pene.* = "A **principled/measured** action is good."

## Compounds

*   **[[SISI]]** = Number (*si* + *si* = "number number")
*   **SIPU** = System, Mechanism (*si* + *pu* = "rule-based structure")
*   **[[TILOSI]]** = Clock, Schedule (*tilo* + *si* = "time measured/regulated")
*   **[[SIPENE]]** = Harmony, Justice, Fairness, Golden Ratio (*si* + *[[pene]]* = "principle/standard of beauty/goodness")
*   **[[LISUSI]]** = Grammar, Syntax; Definition (*lisu* + *si* = "word rule/principle")

## Origin

*   **Navajo**: *hashké* ("rule, law") - Conceptual resonance.
*   **French**: *Système International* (SI units) - Inspiration for measurement aspect.
*   **Latin**: *scientia* (knowledge, implying principles) - Distant conceptual link.

## Proverbs

# NU

IPA::               /ˈnu/
Concept::       **Succession, That Which Comes After, The Next (in time, space, sequence), The Future**
Action::        **To follow, to succeed, to come after**
Descriptor::    **Following, Subsequent, Next, Coming, New (by implication)**

> Root indicating something that comes *after* something else in sequence, time, or spatial arrangement. Contrasts with *KE* (preceding). The *implication* of newness arises from something being subsequent to what exists, but the core meaning is relational succession.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to that which comes after, the next step, or the future in general.

Example::   *Le **nu** o u.* = "The **next (thing) / future** is uncertain." (*le* required to mark as Concept).

Example::   *A pai **nu**.* = "I think about **what comes next / the future**." (*nu* as Concept/Object).

Example::   *An pu **nu**.* = "We create the **future**." (Subject *an*, Verb *pu* implied, Object *nu*).

### Action
*   The act of following or succeeding something/someone.

Example::   *A **nu** e.* = "I **follow** you." (C-A-C flow; e.g., in line, or time).

Example::   *Le pai se **nu** le sun se.* = "That thought **follows** that knowledge." (C-A-C flow).

Example::   *Ko pene **nu** ko u.* = "Good lifeforms **follow** chaotic lifeforms." (e.g., in ecological succession).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being later in time, space, or sequence; subsequent or next. Can imply "new" through context.

Example::   *Se o pu **nu**.* = "That is the **following/subsequent/next** form." (Predicate Descriptor).

Example::   *Ouman **nu** ta toki.* = "The **next/following** person speaks." (*nu* modifies *ouman*).

Example::   *Le **nu nu** sun o u.* = "The **very next / far future** knowledge is uncertain." (Reduplication implying further succession).

### Temporal & Sequential Usage (as Descriptor)
*   Often used descriptively, frequently with the locative marker *ne*, to specify a subsequent time frame or sequence point.

Example::   *A hat tape **ne nu**.* = "I will have food (in the following time/moment)." (*nu* describes the temporal point marked by *ne*).

Example::   *E o **ne nu** ro a.* = "You are at the following position relative to me." / "You are after me (in sequence)." (*nu* describes the position marked by *ne*).

Example::   *Ne **nu** timo, ouman ta nu ma.* = "In **following** time (lit. at following time), sentient beings will explore new lands." (*nu ma* = new lands).

-   **[[NUKO]]** (*NU* + *KO*): Offspring, New Generation ("following lifeform").
-   **[[NUHEIM]]** (*NU* + *HEIM*): New Settlement, Modern Dwelling ("following/next home").

## Origin

-   **Germanic**: Resonates with _new_, _neu_, _ny_. Core meaning shifted to sequence, but 'newness' remains a strong implication.
-   **Latin**: _novus_ ("new") and _sequor_ ("follow") provide conceptual links.
-   **Proto-Indo-European**: Roots like *\*neu̯os* ("new") often carried connotations of change and succession.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Pai nu, ta nu.* = "Think (about) the next (step), take the next (action)."
Okay, let's revise the dictionary entry for **SE** to incorporate its role as an optional marker for the consequent clause ("then") in conditional structures.

# SE

IPA::				/ˈse/
Marker::		**It, That, The (referential particle/pronoun)**
Marker::		**Than (comparative particle)**
Marker::		**Then (optional conditional consequence marker)**
Concept::		**Specificity, The Referenced Item/Instance, That Point**
Action::		**To specify, point out, refer to**
Descriptor::	**Specific, Particular, Said, Aforementioned**

> A highly versatile **Base Set** particle and root. Primarily functions as a **Marker**: a neutral pronoun referring to a specific entity/concept (**it, that, the**), the core particle for comparisons (**than**), and an optional marker introducing the consequence clause in conditionals (**then**). As a concept/action, it relates to the act or idea of **specifying or referencing**.

## Usage

### Marker (Referential Pronoun/Determiner)
*   Functions like a pronoun, referring to a previously established or contextually clear entity, concept, or situation. Gender-neutral. Can sometimes act like a definite article ("the specific one").

Example::   *Neko o pene. **Se** o li.* = "The cat is beautiful. **It** is small."

Example::   ***Se** o sun ro a.* = "**That is** my knowledge."

Example::   *A pai **se** lisu.* = "I think about **that/the specific** word."

### Marker (Comparative "than")
*   Used after the quality/descriptor in comparisons to introduce the standard being compared against.

Example::   *Neko o li inuko **se**.* = "The cat is smaller **than** the dog."

Example::   *Mo **se** e.* = "Bigger **than** you."

### Marker (Conditional Consequence "then" - Optional)
*   Optionally introduces the main clause (apodosis) in a conditional sentence, following a condition marked by *Usi*. It adds clarity, especially in spoken language.

Example::   *Usi a hat tape, **se** a pa ne e.* = "If I have food, **then** I give [it] to you."

Example::   *Usi timo o pene, **se** an wai.* = "If the time is good, **then** we flow/go."

Example::   *Usi e sun, **se** toki.* = "If you understand, **then** speak." (Marker optional but adds flow).

### Concept
*   The idea of specificity, the exact item being discussed, or "that particular point/case." Often requires **le**.

Example::   *A pai le **se**.* = "I think about **that specific point/instance**."

Example::   *Le **se** ro toki o mo.* = "The **specificity/that exact point** of the speech is important."

### Action
*   The act of making something specific, pointing it out, or referring to it pointedly. Requires **ta**.

Example::   *A **ta se** le sun nu.* = "I **specify/refer to** the new knowledge."

Example::   ***Ta se** le lisu!* = "**Point out/Specify** the word!"

### Descriptor
*   Modifies a noun to mean "that specific one," "the particular one mentioned," or "aforementioned." Often requires **so**.

Example::   *A hat heim **so se**.* = "I have **that specific** home (we discussed)."

Example::   *Lisu **so se** o u.* = "**The aforementioned** word is uncertain."

## Compounds
*   **[[Seno]]** (**se** + **no**): Zero, nothingness ("that which is not," "the non-specific thing").

## Origin
*   **Wolof**: *ci* ("at, than") - Comparative inspiration.
*   **Japanese**: より (_yori_, "than") - Structural similarity in comparison.
*   **Latin**: _sē_ ("itself/themselves") - Reference inspiration.


## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Se o se.* = "That is that." / "It is specific."

Proverb:: *Usi sun, se ta.* = "If (there is) clarity/understanding, then act."
# SO
IPA::				/ˈso/
Marker::		**Descriptor marker (adjective/adverb)**
Concept::		**Stability, stillness, stasis, calm, balance (static)**
Action::		**To stabilize, to become still, to calm down, to remain unchanged**
Descriptor::	**Stable, still, static, calm, balanced (static)**

> Primarily an optional particle used to explicitly mark the following word as a descriptor (adjective/adverb). Secondarily, represents the concept of stability, stillness, or static balance, contrasting with TA (movement) and U (chaos).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Precedes a word to signal its function as a descriptor, modifying either a concept (noun) or an action (verb). *This is usually the default interpretation unless context strongly implies the 'Stability' meaning.*

Example::	***So** mo neko o pene.* = "The **big** cat is beautiful." - 'so' functions purely as a marker for 'mo'.

Example::	*A ta pai **so** pene.* = "I think **well / beautifully**." - 'so' functions purely as a marker for 'pene'.

### Concept
*   Refers to the state of being stable, unchanging, or calm.

Example::	*Le **so** o pene.* = "The **stillness/calm** is good." - 'le' marks 'so' as the concept noun.

Example::	*A pai **so**.* = "I think about **stability**." / "My thought is **stillness**."
- Ambiguous - could mean "I think calmly" (see Action/Descriptor).

### Action
*   The act of becoming or making stable or still.

Example::	*Wai **ta so**.* = "The water **becomes still / stabilizes**."

Example::	*A **ta so** le pai.* = "I **stabilize/calm** the mind."

### Descriptor
*   Describes a state of being stable, still, or calm. *Can sometimes overlap with Marker usage if 'so' is the descriptor being marked.*

Example::	*A o **so**.* = "I am **stable/still/calm**." - Here 'so' itself functions as the descriptor linked by 'o'.

Example::	*Sipu **so** o pene.* = "A **stable** system is good." - Here 'so' acts as an adjective describing 'sipu'.

Example::	*A hat **so so** pai.* = "I have a **very stable/calm** mind." - Reduplication for emphasis. `so` marks `so`.

## Compounds
- **[[SOHEIM]]** = Foundation, anchor point, safe haven (*so + heim* = "stable home/center")
- **[[SOTILO]]** = Period of calm, stasis (*so + timo* = "still time")
- **[[SOWAI]]** = Still water, pool, calm liquid (*so + wai* = "still water")
- **[[SOKO]]** = Hibernation, dormancy, stable life state (*so + ko* = "still lifeform")

## Origin
- **English** _so_, _slow_, _stop_

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ta so, so o.* = "To stabilize is to be."
Proverb:: *U no so, so no u.* = "Chaos is not stable, stability is not chaos."
Proverb:: *I so, sun wai.* = "In stillness, clarity/understanding flows."
# SUN

IPA::				/ˈsun/
Concept::		**Illumination, Clarity, Guiding Principle, Objective Information/Knowledge (as an ideal), Understanding**
Action::		**To illuminate, clarify, understand (as alignment), orient towards truth, grasp principle**
Descriptor::	**Illuminated, Clear, Bright, Lucid, Principled, Understood (as aligned), Objective (as ideal)**

> Root representing **illumination (physical or metaphorical), clarity of understanding, and the ideal of objective knowledge or guiding principles.** It embodies the light that reveals or the insight that clarifies, distinct from subjective processing (*pai*), stored memory (*lono*), or functional systems (*sipu*). Often implies an orientation towards truth or achieving clarity, rather than complete possession for finite beings.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the ideal of objective knowledge, illumination, a guiding principle, or clarity itself.

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being earlier in time or sequence; prior or former. Can imply "old" through context. Reduplication `ke ke` emphasizes significant precedence (ancient, long past), or previous of previous (-2)

Example::   *Se o pu **ke**.* = "That is the **preceding/prior/former** form."
Example::   *E o ouman **ke** ro maheim an.* = "You are a **former** person of our homeland."

> Compounds built on the past/precedence meaning.

*   [[Kelono]] (`KE` + `[[LONO]]`): History, Record of the Past ("preceding memory"). *(Formerly Kulono)*.
*   [[Keko]] (`KE` + `[[KO]]`): Elder, Ancestor ("preceding lifeform"). *(Formerly Kuko)*.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Meaning swapped with KU. Primarily gets this meaning systemically through the swap, allowing KU to align phonetically with U (Uncertainty) for its Question particle role. Direct phonetic resonance for "past/before" is less strong than for other roots, though distant conceptual links might be considered (e.g., English *keep* related to preserving the past, or the /k/ sound in sequence markers across languages).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Sun ke, o sun nu.* = "Knowing the precedent/past informs the following/future."
Proverb:: *Ke o tama ro lono.* = "The past is the road of memory."
Proverb:: *Ta ke o so.* = "To precede is to be stable (as a foundation for what follows)."

---

This defines `KE` in its new role. With `KU` and `KE` swapped and finalized, and `LO`/`MO`/`LI` defined, the core structural changes are set.

The next logical step would be to finalize `TILO` (Time), as it was directly affected by the `MO`->`LO` swap. Ready for `TILO`?
