# TA

IPA:: 			/ˈtɑ/
Marker:: 		**Action**
Concept:: 	**Action, change, movement**
Action:: 		**To act, to change**
Descriptor:: 	**3, three**
## Usage
### Marker
* Marks the following word as used in its action form.

Example::	*A **ta** tape.* = "I **eat**."
Example::	*E **ta** heim ne a* = "You **aim** at me."
Example::	*Neko **ta** tama.* = "The cat **walks**."

### Concept
*  Transition or state transformation. Marker **le** is needed to distinguish from marker usage.

Example:: *Le ta o se.* = "Action is it."
Example:: *Oum o ta.* = "Everything is change."
Example:: *Ta wai pene.* = "Action flows beautifully."
### Action
* To bring about change, to deliberately act to facilitate transition. Using the action marker doubly is required to avoid ta being used as a marker on the next word.

Example:: *Sun **ta ta** ouman.* = "Knowledge **transforms** humanity."

Example:: *A heim!* = "I target!" - ta is optional in poetic/contextually clear phrases

### Descriptor
* Numeral, always needs [[si]] marker

Example:: ***Si ta** wakohu.* = "Three ducks." - also "Take the duck."; context sensitive.

## Compounds

## Origin

- **Proto-Indo-European**: *deh₂-* ("to give") → Latin *dare*

- **Swahili**: *toka* ("to come from")
