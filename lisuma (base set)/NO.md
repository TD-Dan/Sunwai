# NO

IPA::				/ˈno/
Marker::		**1. Not, No (Negation Particle)**
Marker::		**2. (Prefix) Reversal/Absence of Meaning**
Concept::		**(Derived) Negation, Opposition, Absence**
Action::		**(Derived) To negate, oppose, deny, make absent**
Descriptor::	**(Derived) Negative, Opposite, Absent**

> Fundamental root of negation, opposition, and absence. Primarily functions as a **Negation Particle** before the element it modifies, or as a **highly productive Prefix** attached to roots or compounds to create their semantic opposites or indicate absence. Understanding both roles is crucial.

## Usage

### Marker (1. Negation Particle - `no [X]`)
*   Placed immediately before a word, phrase, or clause to negate its meaning. This is a core grammatical function similar to English "not" or "no".

Example::   *A **no** tape.* = "I am **not** hungry."

Example::   *Se o **no** pene.* = "That is **not** beautiful."

Example::   ***No** an ta heim.* = "**Not** we go home." / "We do **not** go home."

Example::   *A hat **no** sun.* = "I have **no** knowledge." (Lit: "I have not knowledge.")

Example::   *E **no** kan ku?* = "You **can**not?"

### Marker (2. Prefix - Reversal/Absence of Meaning - `noX`)
*   A primary function of `NO` is to act as a **productive prefix** that reverses or negates the core meaning of the following root or compound word. This creates conceptual opposites, antonyms, or signifies the absence of the base concept.
*   This prefix applies broadly to concepts, actions, and descriptors where a logical opposite exists or absence is meaningful.
*   While some common and fundamental `no-` compounds have their own entries (e.g., `[[SENO]]`, `[[NOPENE]]`, `[[NOLONO]]`, `[[NOSUN]]`), this principle applies generally. Rely on context and the meaning of the base word to understand `no-` prefixed forms.

* *pene* ("beauty/good")  		-> ***nopene*** ("bad/ugly/disharmonious")
Example:: *Le **nopene** o u.* = "The **badness/ugliness** is chaos."

> Notice difference with previous *Se o no pene* -> "It is not beautiful" **vs.** *Se o nopene* = "It is ugly."

* *lono* ("memory/remember") 	-> ***nolono*** ("forgotten/unremembered")
Example:: *A lono, kas e **nolono** timo se.* = "I remember, but you **forget** that time." 

* *sun* ("clarity/knowledge") 	-> ***nosun*** ("nonknowledge/ignorance")
Example:: *Sun o lumia; **nosun** o senokulo.* = "Clarity is light; **ignorance** is blackness."

 * *kan* -> ("can/possible") 		-> ***nokan*** ("impossible/unable")
Example:: *Se o **nokan**.* = "That is **impossible**."

 * *an* ("togetherness")			-> ***noan*** ("separation")
Example:: *An o pene; **noan** o nopene.* = "Togetherness is good; **separation** is bad."

 *kune* -> ("touch/tangible") -> ***nokune*** = ("lack of tangibility")
Example:: *Wai o kune; ha o **nokune**.* = "Water is tangible; air is **intangible/untouchable**." 

* *ko* ("lifeform")				-> ***noko*** = ("absence of life")
Example::  *Lumia o ko; lu o **noko**.* = "Light is life-supporting; the void is **lifeless/without lifeforms**." 

 * *ta* ("action/change") 		->  ***nota*** ("lack of action/change")
Example::  *Ta o ko; so o **nota**.* = "Action/Change is life; stillness is **inaction/stasis**."


> **Pronunciation recommendation:** While the standard pronunciation is /no/, speakers should lenghten the vowel (/noː/) when NO is used as a prefix for added clarity or emphasis (e.g., nopene should be pronounced /ˈnoːpene/). This aligns with the standard stress pattern of lenghtening the first vowel of a word. This can of course be omitted if user prefers another stressing for any reason.

### Concept (Derived)
*   Refers to the concept of negation, opposition, or absence itself. Often requires `le`.

Example::   *Le **no** o mo i pai.* = "The concept of **negation/opposition** is significant in thought."
Example::   *A pai **no**.* = "I think about **absence/negation**."

### Action (Derived)
*   The act of negating, opposing, or making something absent. Requires `ta`.

Example::   *A **ta no** le lisu ro e.* = "I **negate/deny** your word."
Example::   *U **ta no** sipene.* = "Chaos **opposes/negates** harmony."

### Descriptor (Derived)
*   Describes something as negative, opposite, or absent. Requires `so`.

Example::   *Se o pai **so no**.* = "That is a **negative/opposing** thought."
Example::   *Lumia o **no** ne lu.* = "Light is **absent** in the void."

## Compounds
*   **[[Seno]]** (*se + no*): Zero, Nothingness ("that which is specifically not there").
*   **[[Nopene]]** (*no + pene*): Bad, Ugly, Disharmonious, Ill ("not good/beautiful").
*   **[[Nolono]]** (*no + lono*): Forgetfulness, Amnesia ("not memory").
*   **[[Nosun]]** (*no + sun*): Ignorance, Darkness, Lack of clarity ("not illumination/knowledge").
*   **[[Nokan]]** (*no + kan*): Impossible, Unable, Incapable ("not possible/able").
*   **Other potential `no-` compounds are generally understood through the prefix rule and context, rather than needing dedicated entries.**

## Origin
*   **Proto-Indo-European**: *\*ne* (negation particle). Shared ancestor of many common negators.
*   **English**: _no_, _not_.
*   **German**: _nein_ ("no"), _nicht_ ("not").
*   **Latin**: _non_ ("not").

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ta no, o ta kas.* = "To negate is to separate/distinguish."

Proverb:: *Oum hat no.* = "Everything has its opposite/negation."
