# LU

IPA::				/ˈlu/
Concept::		**Void, Emptiness (potential), Unmanifest Potential, Openness**
Action::		**To empty, to clear, to create space, to become void/open**
Descriptor::	**Void, Empty (neutral), Open, Unmanifest**

> Root representing unstructured, potential-filled emptiness, the cosmic void, or simply an open, unoccupied state. Contrasts with *[[MA]]* (substance), *[[OUM]]* (totality), and *[[U]]* (active chaos). Neutral connotation – neither good nor bad, just potential.
