> Represents the state or concept of freedom from constraint, limitation, or external control.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the state or ideal of freedom.

Example::   *Le **lutaum** o pene.* = "The **freedom** is beautiful."
Example::   *A hat **lutaum**.* = "I have **freedom**."
Example::   *Tilo **lutaum**!* = "Time of **freedom**!"

### Action
*   The act of setting something free or being in a state of freedom.

## Compounds
*   **[[Oumanlutaum]]** (*[[ouman]]* + *lutaum*): Free Will ("Sentient Freedom").

## Origin
*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[LU]]** (Void, potential, openness) + **[[TA]]** (Action, change) + **[[OUM]]** (All, everything, unity). Conceptualizes freedom as "Void Action Everything" – the potential (*LU*) for any (*OUM*) action (*TA*). The internal 'o' of *OUM* is dropped during compounding: *lu + ta + (o)um -> lutaum*.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Lutaum o sun.* = "Freedom is knowledge/clarity." (Understanding brings freedom).
Proverb:: *Seno lutaum, seno pai.* = "Without freedom, no thought/play."
