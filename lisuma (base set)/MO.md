# MO

IPA::				/ˈmo/
Concept::		**Size (multi-dimensional), Scale, Intensity, Magnitude (non-linear), Degree**
Action::		**To enlarge (size), intensify, amplify, increase scale/degree**
Descriptor::	**Big, Large (size/area/volume); Intense, Loud, Bright, High (degree/scale), Great**

> Root representing magnitude concerning multi-dimensional size (area, volume), intensity (loudness, brightness, force), or abstract scale/degree. Answers "how big?" or "how intense?". Contrasts with [[#LO]] (linear length, duration) and its direct opposite is [[#LI]] (small, low intensity). Does not imply importance or significance.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the quality of largeness (in size), intensity, or degree. Often requires [[#le]].

Example::   *Le **mo** ro heim o pene.* = "The **size** of the home is beautiful." (Focus on area/volume).
Example::   *Le **mo** ro lumia o u.* = "The **intensity/brightness** of the light is chaotic."
Example::   *A pai **mo**.* = "I contemplate **scale/intensity**."
Example::   *Se o **mo** lo.* = "That is **greatness** itself." (Magnitude/Intensity - using *lo* descriptor here feels potentially wrong/confusing. Let's rephrase: *Se o mo.* = "That is greatness/intensity.")
Example::   *Se o **mo**.* = "That is **greatness/intensity**." (Better).

### Action
*   To make something larger in size, more intense, or to amplify its scale/degree. Often requires [[#ta]].

Example::   *A ta **mo** le heim.* = "I **enlarge** the home (in size)."
Example::   *Ta **mo** le wailu!* = "**Amplify/Intensify** the sound!"
Example::   *Lumia **mo** ne sun.* = "Light **intensifies** in the sun." (Focus on brightness/intensity).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being large (in size/area/volume), intense, loud, bright, or high in degree/scale. Reduplication *mo mo* emphasizes extreme size or intensity (huge, immense, very intense).

Example::   *A hat heim **mo**.* = "I have a **large** home." (Size, not necessarily length).
Example::   *Se o ko **mo**.* = "That is a **large/big** lifeform." (Size/volume).
Example::   *Wailu **mo** o no pene.* = "**Loud** sound is not pleasant."
Example::   *Pai ro e o **mo mo**.* = "Your thought/idea is **immense/very intense**."
Example::   *Se o **mo** pene.* = "That is **great** beauty." (High degree).
