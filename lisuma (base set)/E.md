> Prime root representing the 'other' – anything external to the observer (*[[A]]*). It signifies duality, the object of observation or interaction, and the external world or entities. Contrasts with *A* (self/subjective) and *SE* (specific neutral reference).

## Usage

### Marker (Pronoun)
*   Second-person singular/plural pronoun ("You").

Example::   ***E** o pene!* = "**You** are beautiful!"

### Marker (Referential)
*   Refers to an external object, concept, or person already established or contextually clear, emphasizing its 'otherness' compared to the speaker. Less specific than *SE*.

Example::   *A kulumia neko. **E** li.* = "I see the cat. **It (that other being)** is small."
Example::   *Sun o **e**.* = "Knowledge is **that external thing**."

### Concept
*   Refers to the concept of the 'other', an external object, or the target of interaction. Often requires *le*.

Example::   *Le **e** o sun a.* = "The **Other** is the knowledge of the Self."
Example::   *A pai le **e**.* = "I think about **the external/the other**."

### Action
*   The act of interacting with, addressing, or engaging something external. Requires *ta* for clarity.

Example::   *A **ta e** le maheim.* = "I **interact with/engage** the homeland."
Example::   *Ta **e** le sipu!* = "**Address/Engage** the system!"
Example::   *An **e**.* = "We **interact**."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being external, objective (from the observer's viewpoint), apparent, or simply 'other'.

Example::   *Se o sun **so e**.* = "That is **external/objective** knowledge."
Example::   *Sipu o **e**.* = "The system is **external/other** (separate from me)."
Example::   *Pai ro e o **e**.* = "Your thought is **objective/apparent** (to me)."
Example::   *Ko **e** o pene.* = "The **other** lifeform is beautiful."

## Compounds
*   **[[Esun]]** (*E* + *[[SUN]]*): Objective Knowledge, External Truth ("other/external knowledge").
*   **[[Eheim]]** (*E* + *[[HEIM]]*): External Target/Focus; The World (as external center).

## Origin

*   **Finnish**: *te* ("you" plural/formal).
*   **Mandarin**: 爾/尔 (*ěr*, archaic "you").

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ta a, o ta e.* = "To observe (self) is to interact with (other)."

Proverb:: *Sun a o sun e.* = "Knowledge of self is knowledge of the other."

Proverb:: *Seno e, seno a.* = "Without the other, no self."
