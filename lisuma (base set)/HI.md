Concept::		**Height, Highness, Altitude; Sky, Upper Region, Above**
Action::		**To rise, to ascend, to elevate; To be high/elevated**
Descriptor::	**High, Elevated, Above, Lofty, Upward**

> Root of height, elevation, the sky, and upward direction/movement. Contrasts directly with *[[UN]]* (low, below), benefiting from the high-front vowel /i/ opposition to the low-back vowel /u/.

Example::   ***Hi** ro ma o mo.* = "The **height** of the mountain (earth) is great."

### Action
*   The act of rising, ascending, or becoming high. Requires *[[ta]]*.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Core CV root. **Meaning swapped with *[[HU]]*** to create a stronger phonetic contrast between **HI** (/i/, high) and **UN** (/u/, low). */i/* is a high-front vowel, fitting the concept systemically within Sunwai's vowel space.

*   **German**: *hoch* ("high") (Conceptual link retained).
