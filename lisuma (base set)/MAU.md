# MAU

IPA::				/maˈu/
Concept::		**End, Finish, Completion (esp. returning to base state), Conclusion, Cessation (returning to potential); Grounding point (final), Material Dissolution/Return**
Action::		**To end, finish, complete, conclude, cease (esp. returning to potential/base); To ground finally, return to source**
Descriptor::	**Finished, Completed, Concluded, Final, Ended (returning to base); Grounded (finally), Returned to potential**

> Represents the conclusion or cessation of an action, process, or entity, often implying a return to a foundational state, the ground, or potential. Derived from foundation/ground (*[[MA]]*) and chaos/uncertainty/potential/cessation (*[[U]]*). It signifies completion by reaching a stable base or dissolving back into potential. Contrasts with starting (*[[AMA]]*) and ongoing action (*[[TA]]*).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the end, finish, final state, or point of return/dissolution.

Example::   *Le **mau** ro tama o sun.* = "The **end** of the road is known."
Example::   *A sun **mau** ro tilo.* = "I understand the **end** of the time/cycle."
Example::   *Se o **mau** ro toki.* = "That is the **conclusion** of the speech."
Example::   ***Mau** o ama nu.* = "The **end** is a new beginning."

### Action
*   The act of finishing, concluding, returning something to its base state, or dissolving into potential.

Example::   *A **ta mau** le toki.* = "I **finish/conclude** the speech."
Example::   *Ta **mau** se!* = "**Finish** that! / **Bring it to its end state!**"
Example::   *Ko **mau** i ma.* = "Life **ends/returns** to the earth."
Example::   *Sipu **mau** i lu.* = "The system **concludes/dissolves** into potential."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being finished, final, concluded, or having returned to a base/potential state. Optional *so* marker.

Example::   *Le toki o **mau**.* = "The speech is **finished/concluded**."
Example::   *A o **mau**.* = "I am **finished/done** (returning to rest/potential)."
Example::   *Sipu o **mau**.* = "The system is **complete/at its end state**."
Example::   *Se o **mau** pu.* = "That is the **final/grounded** form."

## Compounds
*   **[[Mauheim]]** (*mau* + *HEIM*): Final resting place, Graveyard; Conclusion point ("end/return home/center").
*   **[[Mauko]]** (*mau* + *KO*): Corpse, Deceased body (returned to earth/potential) ("end/return lifeform").

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **MA** (Earth, Land, Foundation, Material) + **U** (Chaos, Uncertainty, Rotation, Potential, Cessation). Conceptualized as "Returning to Foundation/Potential," "Foundation reaching Potential/Cessation," or "Final Grounding before Uncertainty/Potential."
*   **Maori**: _mau_ ("be firm, fixed, lasting, caught, held")
*   **Hawaiian**:  _pau_ ("finished, ended, completed, consumed, all gone")
*   **Arabic**: _تمام_ (_tamām_, "complete, perfect, finished")
