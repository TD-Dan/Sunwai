*   **Global**: Phonetically resonates with the near-universal /mama/ sound often associated with "mother" across diverse language families (e.g., Mandarin *妈妈*, Swahili *mama*, Quechua *mama*, English *mama*), enhancing recognizability while retaining Sunwai's internal logic and gender-neutrality.
