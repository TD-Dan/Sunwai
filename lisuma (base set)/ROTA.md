# ROTA

IPA::				/ˈɾo.tɑ/
Concept::		**Taking, Acquisition, Getting, Selection, Obtaining, Undertaking**
Action::		**To take, acquire, get, obtain, select, choose, pick up; To undertake, engage in (an activity/responsibility)**
Descriptor::	**Taken, acquired, selected, undertaken**

> Represents the action of bringing something into one's possession, control, or sphere of activity. This includes physical acquisition, selection from options, and the undertaking of tasks or responsibilities. Derived from *[[RO]]* (possession) and *[[TA]]* (action). Contrasts with *[[PA]]* (to give) and *[[HAT]]* (to have/possess - state resulting from taking).

## Usage

### Action (Primary Use)
*   The act of acquiring, selecting, or undertaking.

   *   **Physical Acquisition/Obtaining:**
Example::   *A **rota** paitape.* = "I **take/get** the cake."
Example::   *Neko **rota** lumako li.* = "The cat **catches/takes** the small plant (e.g., a blade of grass)."
Example::   *E **rota** ku tape un pisu?* = "Did you **get/obtain** which food from the market?" (Using *TA...UN* might still be more natural for "from a source," e.g., *E ta ku tape un pisu?* But *ROTA* can imply the act of selection/purchase there).

 *   **Selection/Choosing:**
Example::   *A **rota** tama aikulo.* = "I **take/choose** the red path."
Example::   *Pae mu lisu, e **rota** lisu se.* = "From many words, you **select** that word."

   *   **Undertaking/Engaging In:**
Example::   *An **rota** le ta mo.* = "We **undertake** the big task/action."
Example::   *A **rota** haitoki an e.* = "I **take up/engage in** conversation with you." (As you used it!)
Example::   *E **rota** tilon pae sun?* = "Do you **take/make** time for knowledge?"

   *   **Taking something with (implied movement):**
Example::   *A **rota** sun an a pae maheim nu.* = "I **take** knowledge with me for the new land." (Lit: "I take knowledge and me for new land" - *an a* might be better as *an ro a* "of me" or simply contextual). Better: *A rota sun; A wai an sun se pae maheim nu.* (I take knowledge; I go with that knowledge for the new land.) *ROTA* focuses on the acquisition/selection, subsequent movement uses *WAI* or *TA*.

### Concept
*   Refers to the act or concept of taking, acquisition, or selection itself. Often requires *[[le]]*.

Example::   *Le **rota** o no pa.* = "The **act of taking** is not giving."
Example::   *Sipu **rota** o mo.* = "The system of **acquisition** is complex."
Example::   *Le **rota** ro e o pene.* = "Your **selection/choice** is good."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as having been taken, acquired, or selected.

Example::   *Se o tape **so rota**.* = "That is **taken/acquired** food."
Example::   *Lisu **rota** o sun.* = "The **selected** word is clear."
Example::   *Le tama **rota** o li.* = "The **undertaken** path is short."

## Distinctions

*   **vs. *HAT* (to have):** *ROTA* is the action of getting. *HAT* is the state of already possessing.
    *   *A rota paitape. Sunta, a hat paitape.* (I take the cake. Therefore, I have the cake.)
*   **vs. *PA* (to give):** *ROTA* is acquisition by the agent. *PA* is bestowal by the agent.
*   **vs. *TA ... UN ...* (to action from):** *TA ... UN ...* emphasizes removal from a source. *ROTA* emphasizes the agent's acquisition or selection, and can be from a presented set rather than removal from a previous possessor/location.
    *   *A ta tape un pisu.* (I take/get food from the market - focuses on removal from market).
    *   *A rota tape ne pisu.* (I take/select/buy food at the market - focuses on act of acquiring it for myself at the location).
*   **vs. *KUNE* (to touch/handle):** *KUNE* is often the physical precursor to *ROTA*. You *kune* (touch/grasp) an object, then you *rota* (take) it.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **RO** (Possession, Of, 's) + **TA** (Action, Change, Process, Function). Conceptualized as the "Action of (bringing into) Possession."
