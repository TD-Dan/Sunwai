# SUN

IPA::				/ˈsun/
Concept::		**Illumination, Clarity, Guiding Principle, Objective Information/Knowledge (as an ideal), Understanding**
Action::		**To illuminate, clarify, understand (as alignment), orient towards truth, grasp principle**
Descriptor::	**Illuminated, Clear, Bright, Lucid, Principled, Understood (as aligned), Objective (as ideal)**

> Root representing **illumination (physical or metaphorical), clarity of understanding, and the ideal of objective knowledge or guiding principles.** It embodies the light that reveals or the insight that clarifies, distinct from subjective processing (*[[pai]]*), stored memory (*[[lono]]*), or functional systems (*[[sipu]]*). Often implies an orientation towards truth or achieving clarity, rather than complete possession for finite beings.
