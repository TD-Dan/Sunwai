# LO

IPA::				/Ëˆlo/
Concept::		**Length, Extension (spatial, 1D); Duration (temporal); Tallness**
Action::		**To lengthen, extend (linearly), prolong; To last, endure (over time)**
Descriptor::	**Long (length/duration), Tall, Lasting**

> Root representing linear extension in space (length, height) or extension in time (duration). Answers "how long?". Contrasts with [[#MO]] (multi-dimensional size, intensity) and is the direct opposite of [[#LI]] (short, brief).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the quality of linear extension or duration itself. Often requires [[#le]].

Example::   *Le **lo** ro tama o u.* = "The **length** of the road is uncertain."
Example::   *Le **lo** ro tilo o li.* = "The **duration** of the time is short." (Using [[#TILO]])
Example::   *A pai **lo**.* = "I contemplate **duration/length**."

### Action
*   To make something longer, taller, or to prolong its duration; or the process of lasting/enduring. Often requires [[#ta]].

Example::   *A ta **lo** le tama.* = "I **lengthen** the road."
Example::   *Ta **lo** le tilo!* = "**Prolong** the time!" (Using [[#TILO]])
Example::   *Ouman **lo** ne tilo lo.* = "Humans **endure/last** for a long time." (Using [[#TILO]] and `lo` as descriptor).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being long (in length or duration) or tall. Reduplication `lo lo` emphasizes extreme length/duration.

Example::   *A hat tama **lo**.* = "I have/take a **long** road."
Example::   *Ouman se o **lo**.* = "That person is **tall**."
Example::   *Se o tilo **lo lo**.* = "That was a **very long** time." (Using [[#TILO]])
Example::   *A kutape **lo**.* = "I experience a **lasting** taste." (Focus on duration; using new `kutape`).

## Compounds

*   [[#TILO]] (`[[#TI]]` + `lo`): Time, Duration ("Extended Interval").
*   [[#KULO]] (`[[#KU]]` [Sense] + `lo`): Color ("Sensed Length" -> Wavelength).
*   [[#LOTAMA]] (`lo` + `[[#TAMA]]`): Long road, highway (emphasizing length).
*   [[#LONONO]] (`lo` + `[[#LONO]]`): Epic, saga, long-term memory/history ("long memory").
*   [[#LOHU]] (`lo` + `[[#HU]]`): Height, altitude ("long high").
*   [[#LOKO]] (`lo` + `ko`): Elongated/Tall lifeform (e.g., snake, giraffe).

## Origin

*   **English**: _long_.
*   **Latin**: _longus_ ("long").
*   **Germanic**: Shared roots for "long" (e.g., German _lang_).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Tilo lo lo o senotilo.* = "A very long time is (like) no time." (Shared with [[#TILO]]).
Proverb:: *Tama lo o no tama li.* = "A long road is not a short road." (Obvious truth, highlights the opposition).
Proverb:: *Sun ro lo o sun.* = "Understanding duration/length is wisdom."
