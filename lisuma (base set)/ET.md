# ET

IPA::				/ˈet/
Concept::		**Nearness, Proximity, Closeness; Adjacency, Vicinity**
Action::		**To approach, to come near, to be close to, to adjoin**
Descriptor::	**Near, Close (by), Adjacent, Proximate**

> Root of spatial proximity or nearness. Contrasts with concepts of distance (implied opposite) and specific locations like [[UN]] (under) or [[HI]] (above). The initial 'E' sound subtly links to nearness *relative to* an 'other' or external point.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the state or quality of being near or close.

Example::   *Le **et** ro a an e o pene.* = "The **nearness/closeness** between me and you is good."

Example::   *A pai **et**.* = "I think about **proximity**." / "I feel the **nearness**."

Example::   ***Et** o tilo li.* = "**Nearness/Proximity** is a short time."

### Action
*   The act of moving closer, being adjacent to, or approaching something.

Example::   *A **ta et** e.* = "I **approach** you." / "I **come near** you."

Example::   *Heim **et** wai.* = "The home **is close to / adjoins** the water."

Example::   *Ta **et** le un!* = "**Approach** the low point!" / "**Get close** to what's underneath!"

Example::   *Ouman **et** ouman.* = "People **approach/gather near** people."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being spatially close or adjacent. Often used with locative markers like [[ne]] or modifies a noun.

Example::   *A o **ne et** e.* = "I am **(located) near** you."

Example::   *Se o heim **et**.* = "That is a **nearby** home."

Example::   *Wai **so et** o pene.* = "**Nearby** water is good." (`so` optional descriptor marker).

Example::   *An hat pai **et**.* = "We have **close/similar** thoughts." (Metaphorical extension).
