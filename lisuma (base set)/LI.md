# LI

IPA::				/ˈli/
Concept::		**Smallness, Littleness, Subtlety, Minimalism; Shortness (length/duration), Brevity; Low Intensity/Scale/Degree**
Action::		**To reduce, minimize, shorten, decrease (size/intensity/scale), become small/short/brief/subtle**
Descriptor::	**Small, Little, Subtle, Minimal; Short (length/duration), Brief; Quiet, Dim, Few, Low (intensity/scale/degree)**

> Root representing the lesser pole on all scales of magnitude. It is the opposite of both [[LO]] (long, duration) and [[MO]] (big size, intensity). Covers smallness, shortness, brevity, subtlety, low intensity, fewness, quietness, dimness, etc. Neutral connotation - does not imply insignificance or powerlessness.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the quality of being small, subtle, short, brief, or low in intensity/scale. Often requires [[le]].

Example::   *Le **li** o pene.* = "The **smallness/subtlety/brevity** is beautiful."
Example::   *Le **li** ro tilo o sun.* = "The **shortness** (duration) of the time is known." (Using [[TILO]])
Example::   *Le **li** ro heim o ke.* = "The **small size** of the home is past/former." (Using new `KE`)
Example::   *A pai **li**.* = "I contemplate **minimalism/subtlety**."

### Action
*   To make something smaller, shorter, briefer, less intense, or to decrease its scale; or the process of becoming so. Often requires [[ta]].

Example::   *A ta **li** tape.* = "I **reduce** the food (portion)."
Example::   *Ta **li** le tilo!* = "**Shorten** the time!" (Using [[TILO]])
Example::   *Ta **li** le wailu!* = "**Quiet/Reduce** the sound!"
Example::   *Oum **li** ne tilo.* = "Everything **diminishes/becomes smaller/shorter** over time."

### ### Descriptor
*   Describes something as small (size), short (length/duration), brief, few, quiet, dim, low (intensity/scale/degree), subtle, etc. Reduplication `li li` emphasizes the extreme (tiny, minuscule, very brief, very quiet/dim).

Example::   *Neko o **li**.* = "The cat is **small**." (Size)
Example::   *A hat tama **li**.* = "I have/take a **short** road." (Length)
Example::   *Se o tilo **li**.* = "That was a **brief** time." (Duration, using [[TILO]])
Example::   *Wailu **li li** o pene.* = "A **very quiet/faint** sound is beautiful." (Intensity)
Example::   *Mu ouman **li** ne heim.* = "**Few** people are in the home." (Use `mu li` if quantity emphasis needed, else `li` implies fewness in context of people count).
Example::   *Lumia **li** o so.* = "The **dim** light is stable." (Intensity)
Example::   *Se o **li** kemo.* = "That is a **subtle/pale** color." (Low degree/intensity, using new `KEMO`). *Correction: Use KULO.*
Example::   *Se o **li** kulo.* = "That is a **subtle/pale** color." (Low degree/intensity, using new `KULO`).

## Compounds

*   [[Lima]] = Dust, sand, fine particle (*li* + *ma* = "small earth").
*   [[Liko]] = Insect, microbe, small creature (*li* + *ko* = "small lifeform").
*   [[Likulo]] = Pale color, Low saturation, Pastel (*li* + *[[KULO]]* = "small/subtle color").
*   [[Litilo]] = Moment, brief period (*li* + *[[TILO]]* = "short time").
*   [[Litama]] = Shortcut, short path (*li* + *[[TAMA]]* = "short road").
*   [[Lilima]] = Minimum, minima (*li* + *li* + *ma* = "really small low/ground").
*   [[Liki]] = Whisper, quiet communication, subtle signal (*li* + *[[KI]]* = "small communication").
*   [[Lisun]] = Detail, specific fact, minor point (*li* + *sun* = "small knowledge"). 

## Origin

*   **Hawaiian**: _Liʻiliʻi_ ("small") – Reduplication concept borrowed.
*   **Swedish**: _Liten_ ("small").
*   **Norwegian**: _Lite_ ("little").
*   **English**: _Little_.
*   **Mandarin**: _里_ (_lǐ_, historically a short unit of distance).
*   **Finnish**: _lyhyt_ ("short").

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Li li o pene.* = "Tiny/Brief things are beautiful."
Proverb:: *I li o sun lo.* = "In smallness is great knowledge."
