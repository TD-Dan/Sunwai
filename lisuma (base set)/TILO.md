# TILO

IPA::				/ˈtiː.lo/
Concept::		**Time, Duration; Temporal Rhythm, Temporal Cycle, Temporal Pattern**
Action::		**To time, to pace; To occur in temporal cycles/rhythmically; To last, endure (for a duration)**
Descriptor::	**Temporal, Related to time; Temporally Rhythmic, Temporally Cyclical, Temporally Patterned**

> Root representing the concept of **time, its passage (duration), and recurring patterns or rhythms specifically *within* time.** It is the temporal framework itself. Systematically derived from [[#TI]] (Interval/Rhythm) + [[#LO]] (Length/Duration). Contrasts with [[#PI]] (cycle in any domain).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to time itself, a specific duration, or a recurring temporal pattern.

Example:: *Tilo wai!* = "Time flows!"
Example:: *A hat tilo.* = "I have time."
Example:: *Le **tilo** ro ouman o pi.* = "The **temporal cycle** of humanity is cyclical." (*le* specifies Concept).
Example:: *An pai le **tilo** li.* = "We think about the short **duration**."
Example:: *Pi ro ma o **tilo** lo.* = "The cycle (orbit) of the Earth is a long **time/duration**."

### Action
*   The act of measuring time, pacing actions temporally, occurring rhythmically over time, or lasting for a specific duration.

Example:: *Tiko ta **tilo**.* = "The heart **beats rhythmically/keeps time**."
Example:: *Ta **tilo** le ta!* = "**Pace** the action (over time)!"
Example:: *Se **tilo** lo.* = "It **lasts/endures** long (over time)."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as relating to time, duration, or being rhythmically/cyclically patterned *in time*.

Example:: *Ouman o ko **so tilo**.* = "Humanity is a **temporal** being."
Example:: *Pu o **tilo**.* = "The form is **temporally cyclical/rhythmic**."
Example:: *Se o sun **so tilo**.* = "That is **time-related/temporal** knowledge."

## Compounds

*   [[#Nutilo]] = Future (*[[#nu]]* + *tilo* = "following/next time").
*   [[#Ketilo]] = Past (*[[#ke]]* + *tilo* = "preceding time").
*   [[#Tilopene]] = Good timing, festival, auspicious time (*tilo* + *[[#pene]]* = "good/beautiful time").
*   [[#Tiloheim]] = Clock, calendar, place of timekeeping (*tilo* + *[[#heim]]* = "time home/center/object").
*   [[#Senotilo]] = Timelessness, eternity (*[[#seno]]* + *tilo* = "no time").
*   [[#Tapetilo]] = Mealtime (*[[#tape]]* + *tilo* = "food time").
*   [[#Tilota]] = Journey, travel (experience of moving through time) (*tilo* + *[[#ta]]* = "time action/movement").
*   [[#Tiloli]] = Moment, instant (*tilo* + *[[#li]]* = "small time").
*   [[#Tilosi]] = Schedule, time standard, measured time (*tilo* + *[[#si]]* = "time measure/rule").

## Origin

*   **Penetoki**: **[[#TI]]** (Interval, repetition, rhythm) + **[[#LO]]** (Length, duration, extension). Represents the extension (*LO*) of intervals (*TI*) through time.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ouman o tilo.* = "Humanity is (bound by) time / is a cycle."

Proverb:: *Oum wai ne tilo.* = "Everything flows in time."
