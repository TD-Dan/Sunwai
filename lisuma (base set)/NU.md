# NU

IPA::               /ˈnu/
Concept::       **Succession, That Which Comes After, The Next (in time, space, sequence), The Future**
Action::        **To follow, to succeed, to come after**
Descriptor::    **Following, Subsequent, Next, Coming, New (by implication)**

> Root indicating something that comes *after* something else in sequence, time, or spatial arrangement. Contrasts with *[[KE]]* (preceding). The *implication* of newness arises from something being subsequent to what exists, but the core meaning is relational succession.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to that which comes after, the next step, or the future in general.

Example::   *Le **nu** o u.* = "The **next (thing) / future** is uncertain." (*le* required to mark as Concept).

Example::   *A pai **nu**.* = "I think about **what comes next / the future**." (*nu* as Concept/Object).

Example::   *An pu **nu**.* = "We create the **future**." (Subject *an*, Verb *pu* implied, Object *nu*).

### Action
*   The act of following or succeeding something/someone.

Example::   *A **nu** e.* = "I **follow** you." (C-A-C flow; e.g., in line, or time).

Example::   *Le pai se **nu** le sun se.* = "That thought **follows** that knowledge." (C-A-C flow).

Example::   *Ko pene **nu** ko u.* = "Good lifeforms **follow** chaotic lifeforms." (e.g., in ecological succession).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being later in time, space, or sequence; subsequent or next. Can imply "new" through context.

Example::   *Se o pu **nu**.* = "That is the **following/subsequent/next** form." (Predicate Descriptor).

Example::   *Ouman **nu** ta toki.* = "The **next/following** person speaks." (*nu* modifies *ouman*).

Example::   *Le **nu nu** sun o u.* = "The **very next / far future** knowledge is uncertain." (Reduplication implying further succession).

### Temporal & Sequential Usage (as Descriptor)
*   Often used descriptively, frequently with the locative marker *[[ne]]*, to specify a subsequent time frame or sequence point.

Example::   *A hat tape **ne nu**.* = "I will have food (in the following time/moment)." (*nu* describes the temporal point marked by *ne*).

Example::   *E o **ne nu** ro a.* = "You are at the following position relative to me." / "You are after me (in sequence)." (*nu* describes the position marked by *ne*).

Example::   *Ne **nu** tilo, ouman ta nu ma.* = "In **following** time (lit. at following time), sentient beings will explore new lands." (*nu ma* = new lands).

## Compounds

-   **[[NUTILON]]** (*NU* + *TILO*): Future Time, The Future Era. Provides emphasis beyond *ne nu*.
-   **[[NUKO]]** (*NU* + *KO*): Offspring, New Generation ("following lifeform").
-   **[[NUHEIM]]** (*NU* + *HEIM*): New Settlement, Modern Dwelling ("following/next home").

## Origin

-   **Germanic**: Resonates with _new_, _neu_, _ny_. Core meaning shifted to sequence, but 'newness' remains a strong implication.
-   **Latin**: _novus_ ("new") and _sequor_ ("follow") provide conceptual links.
-   **Proto-Indo-European**: Roots like *\*neu̯os* ("new") often carried connotations of change and succession.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Pai nu, ta nu.* = "Think (about) the next (step), take the next (action)."
