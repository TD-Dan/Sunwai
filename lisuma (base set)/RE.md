# RE

IPA::           /ˈɾe/
Concept::       **Reflection (light/sound/thought); Mirror, Echo; Duality, Pair, Counterpart; Relationship (relative connection)**
Action::        **To reflect, to mirror, to echo; To pair, to relate to, to respond (as counterpart)**
Descriptor::    **Reflective, mirrored, echoing; Dual, paired, relative, corresponding; Two (2)**

> Root representing the phenomenon of mirroring or reflection, encompassing physical reflections (light, sound), conceptual counterparts (duality, pairs), and relational connections. It naturally extends to represent the number **two (2)**, embodying the essence of pairing and duality.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the reflection itself, a mirror image, an echo, a pair, or a relative connection/counterpart.

Example::   *Le **re** ro wai o pene.* = "The **reflection** in the water is beautiful."
Example::   *Oum hat **re**.* = "Everything has its **counterpart/reflection**."
Example::   *An o **re**.* = "We are a **pair**." / "We are related."
Example::   *Wailu o **re**.* = "The sound is an **echo**."

### Action
*   The act of reflecting something, mirroring, echoing, forming a pair, or relating to something else as a counterpart. Requires `ta` marker for clarity if needed.

Example::   *Wai **ta re** mamasun.* = "The water **reflects** the sun."
Example::   *Pai ro e **ta re** pai ro a.* = "Your thought **mirrors** my thought."
Example::   *A **re** ne e.* = "I **respond to / relate to** you (as a counterpart)."
Example::   *An **ta re**.* = "We **pair up**."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being reflective, mirrored, dual, paired, relative, or the number two. Requires `so` for descriptive clarity; requires `si` for numeral usage.

Example::   *Pu o **so re**.* = "The structure is **mirrored/symmetrical**." (`so` optional)
Example::   *Se o sun **re**.* = "That is **relative** knowledge (depends on its counterpart)."
Example::   *An o **so re**.* = "We are **paired/dual**."
Example::   *A hat **si re** ko.* = "I have **two** lifeforms." (`si` required for numeral).
Example::   *Se o **si re**.* = "That is **two**."

## Compounds
*   **[[Repene]]**: Symmetry (`re` + `pene` = "reflection beauty").
*   **[[Retoki]]**: Dialogue, Response (`re` + `toki` = "reflection language").
*   **[[Resun]]**: Relative Truth, Understanding through Comparison (`re` + `sun` = "reflection knowledge").

## Origin
*   **Sunwai:** Newly introduced root. Conceptual core inspired by "reflection," "relation," and "response" to embody duality, fitting for the number 2. Sound `/re/` chosen for clarity and distinctness from other roots/numerals.

## Proverbs
Proverb:: *Oum re oum.* = "Everything reflects everything."
Proverb:: *Ta re sun o pene.* = "To reflect on knowledge is good."
Proverb:: *Si re o an.* = "Two is togetherness (concept)." *(Linking number to the concept AN)*
