# TAWAI

IPA::           /ˈtɑ.wɑi/
Concept::       **Current (flow of liquid, esp. water); River, Stream; Flow of Charge, Electricity**
Action::        **To flow (as current); To stream; To conduct electricity; To power electrically**
Descriptor::    **Flowing (like current), Streaming; Electrical, Electrically powered**

> Represents the directed flow or movement, primarily of liquids like water (current, river) but extended to the flow of electric charge (electricity, electrical current). Derived from action/change (`[[TA]]`) and flow/liquid (`[[WAI]]`). Context usually distinguishes between meanings.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to a river, a stream, a current of water, or electricity itself.

Example::   *Le **tawai** ro ma o lo.* = "The **river** of the land is long."
Example::   *Le **tawai** o mo.* = "The **current** (water or electric) is strong."
Example::   *An na **tawai**.* = "We need **electricity**."
Example::   *Sipu se hat **tawai** li.* = "That system has a weak **current**."

### Action
*   The act of flowing like a river, streaming, or conducting/using electricity.

Example::   *Wai **tawai** ne ma.* = "Water **flows** on the land."
Example::   *Sipu se **tawai** ne tasipu.* = "That system **runs on** energy."
Example::   *Piko **tawai**.* = "The computer **uses electricity**."
Example::   *Ta **tawai** pene!* = "**Conduct/Flow** well!"

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as flowing like a current or being related to electricity.

Example::   *Ma o **tawai**.* = "The land is **streaming** (with rivers)."
Example::   *Piko o **tawai**.* = "The computer is **electrical**."
Example::   *Se o pu **so tawai**.* = "That is an **electrically powered** structure."

## Compounds
*   **[[Tawaiheim]]** (`tawai` + `[[heim]]`): Power station, Dam, Electrical Grid Hub ("electricity/current home/center").
*   **[[Tawaisun]]** (`tawai` + `[[sun]]`): Electrical Engineering, Hydrodynamics ("current/electricity knowledge").
*   **[[Tawaipiko]]** (`tawai` + `[[piko]]`): Electric device ("electricity computer/robot").

## Origin
*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[TA]]** (Action, change, process, function) + **[[WAI]]** (Flow, liquid, change). Represents "Active Flow" or "Functioning Flow."

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Tawai mo o u.* = "A strong current is chaotic/dangerous."
