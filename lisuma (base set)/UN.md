## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the location underneath, the depths, or the state of being hidden or submerged. Often requires [[le]] marker for clarity as a noun.

Example::   ***Un** o timo li.* = "The **low point/depth** is brief."

### Action
*   The act of moving downwards, placing something underneath, submerging, or hiding something below.

Example::   *A ta **un** le wai.* = "I **go under/submerge** in the water."

Example::   *Ta **un** le lumia!* = "**Lower** the light!"

Example::   *An **un** le tape i ma.* = "We **hide** the food **under** the ground." (Lit: We hide food in low-earth).

Example::   *Neko ta **un** ne pu.* = "The cat **hides under** the structure."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being low, underneath, deep, hidden, or submerged. Often uses locative markers like [[ne]] or [[i]] when spatial.

Example::   *Neko o **ne un** le pu.* = "The cat is **(located) under** the structure."

Example::   *Se o sun so **un**.* = "That is **deep/hidden** knowledge."

Example::   *A hat heim **un**.* = "I have a **low** home." (Lower than average, or perhaps below ground level depending on context).

Example::   *Pai **un** o u.* = "**Hidden/Subconscious** thoughts are chaotic."

## Compounds

*   **[[Unheim]]** = Basement, cellar, underground part of a home (*un + heim* = "low/under home").
*   **[[Unma]]** = Underground, subterranean area (*un + ma* = "low/under earth").
*   **[[Unta]]** = Descent, lowering action (*un + ta* = "low/down action").
*   **[[Unpai]]** = Subconscious, underlying thought/motive (*un + pai* = "low/hidden mind/play").
*   **[[Unlono]]** = Deep memory, underlying record (*un + lono* = "low/hidden memory").
*   **[[Unwai]]** = Submersion, underwater state/action (*un + wai* = "under water").

## Origin

*   **German**: *unten* ("below, downstairs").
*   **Latin**:  *sub* ("under")
*   **Sunwai**: Chosen for its simple VC structure, phonetic distinctness, and the use of the back vowel /u/ which can subtly evoke depth or lowness.

## Proverbs
