# KAS

IPA::				/ˈkɑs/
Marker::		**But, However, On the other hand (contrastive particle)**
Concept::		**Separation, Difference, Distinction; Removal, Subtraction (math)**
Action::		**To separate, distinguish, remove, subtract**
Descriptor::	**Separate, Different, Distinct, Removed**

> Represents separation, difference, or removal. Can function as a contrastive particle ("but"), highlighting a distinction or separation between clauses or ideas. Also covers mathematical subtraction. Contrasts with *AN* (togetherness, addition).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Introduces a contrasting clause or idea, similar to "but" or "however." It marks a separation or divergence from the previous statement.

Example::   *A pai se o pene. **Kas**, e pai se o no pene.* = "I think it is good. **But**, you think it is not good."
Example::   *Neko o li. **Kas**, inuko o mo.* = "The cat is small. **However**, the dog is big."
Example::   *Ke sunta nu. **Kas**, nu o no so.* = "The past determines the future. **On the other hand / But**, the future is not fixed."

### Concept
*   Refers to the state of being separate or the act of removal/subtraction. Usually requires `le`.

Example::   *Le **kas** ro a an e o li.* = "The **difference** between me and you is small."
Example::   ***Kas** o pene ne sipu.* = "**Distinction/Separation** is good in a system."
Example::   *Le **kas** ro sisi ka an re o li.* = "The **subtraction** of five and two is three." (`ka` and `re` used as numbers here).

### Action
*   The act of separating, distinguishing, removing, or subtracting. Requires `ta`.

Example::   *A **ta kas** le tape u.* = "I **remove** the bad food."
Example::   *E **ta kas** sun an sun ku?* = "Do you **distinguish** between knowledge and knowledge?"
Example::   *Ta **kas** se!* = "**Remove** that!"
Example::   *Sisi ka **ta kas** re o ta.* = "Five **subtract** two equals three." (`ka` and `re` used as numbers).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being separate, different, or removed. Optional `so`.

Example::   *An o **kas**.* = "We are **separate/different**."
Example::   *Se o sun **so kas**.* = "That is **different** knowledge."
Example::   *Tape o **kas**.* = "The food is **removed**."

## Compounds
*   **[[Nokas]]** (*NO* + *KAS*): Indistinct, Same, Togetherness (negation of separation), Merged ("not separate"). *(Careful: contrasts with AN)*
*   **[[Kasheim]]** (*KAS* + *HEIM*): Isolated place, Quarantine area ("separate home").
*   **[[Kasko]]** (*KAS* + *KO*): Individual (separate lifeform); Corpse (life removed)? *(Meaning needs care)*. Let's stick with "Individual".
*   **[[Kassun]]** (*KAS* + *SUN*): Analysis (separating knowledge); Distinction ("separate knowledge").

## Origin
*   **Sunwai**: Core CV C root. Chosen for phonetic structure (`K`-`S`) suggesting cutting/separation, and strong contrast with `AN`.
*   **Proto-Indo-European**: Strong conceptual resonance with *\*(s)ker-* ("to cut"), ancestor of English _shear_, _scar_, _score_.
*   **Latin**: Conceptual resonance with *castrāre* ("to cut, separate").
*   **Greek**: Conceptual resonance with *κλάω* (*klaō*, "to break") and *σχίζω* (*skhízō*, "to split").

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Kas o tama nu ro pene.* = "Removal/Separation is the path to new harmony." (e.g., removing obstacles)

Proverb:: *Ta kas u, sunta pene so.* = "Separate/Remove chaos, therefore stable harmony."

Proverb:: *Kas o no an.* = "Separation is not togetherness."
