# KULO

IPA::				/ˈkuː.lo/
Concept::		**Color, Hue, Tint; Visual Spectrum Property**
Action::		**To color, add hue, tint; To become colored**
Descriptor::	**Colored, Hued, Chromatic; Number 7**

> Root representing the perceptual property derived from the magnitude/length (wavelength) of light interacting with objects (color, hue). Systematically derived from [[KU]] (Sense) + [[LON]] (Magnitude/Length). It encompasses the entire visual spectrum and individual shades.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the phenomenon of color, a specific hue, or the property of the visual spectrum being perceived. Often requires [[le]] for clarity as a noun.

Example::   *Le **kulo** ro mamasun o pene.* = "The **color** of the sun(set) is beautiful."
Example::   *Oum **kulo** o i lumia.* = "All **color** is within light."
Example::   *A pai **kulo** lo.* = "I think about an intense **color**." / "I perceive a vivid **hue**." (Using new *lo*)
Example::   *Se o **kulo** li.* = "That is a subtle/light **color/hue**."

### Action
*   The act of applying color, adding a tint, or the process of something taking on color. Often requires [[ta]].

Example::   *A ta **kulo** le heim.* = "I **color** the home."
Example::   *Hu **kulo** ne tilon pene.* = "The sky **becomes colored** during the beautiful time (e.g., sunrise/sunset)." (Using new *tilon*)
Example::   *Ta **kulo** se ku?* = "**Color** it?" (Using new question particle *ku*)

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as having color or relating to hue. Optional [[so]] marker clarifies.

Example::   *Kohi o **kulo**.* = "The bird is **colored/colorful**."
Example::   *A hat wai **so kulo**.* = "I have **colored** water."

* Number 7, a reference to the 7 colors in the rainbow:

Example:: *A hat si kulo wahiko.* = "I have seven ducks"

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Systematically derived from **[[KU]]** (sense, perception) + **[[LON]]** (magnitude, scale, length), reflecting the concept of color as the *_"sensed magnitude/length"_* (wavelength) of light. This internal derivation aligns with the external phonetic **resonance** found in many world languages (e.g., Latin _color_, Greek _chrōma_), achieving both systemic logic and learnability. The n in the end is dropped for brevity in compounds and ease of speak.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Kulo o pene ro ku.* = "Color is the beauty of perception/sensation." *(Using new *KU*)*
Proverb:: *Oum ko hat kulo.* = "All life has color."
