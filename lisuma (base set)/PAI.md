Example::	*Le **pai** ro a o u.* = "My **mind/thought process** is chaotic."
Example::	*Se o **pai** ro e.* = "That is your **perspective/opinion**."
Example::	***Pai** o pene!* = "The **game/fun** is good!" 
Example::	*An hat **pai**.* = "We have **fun** / We have **ideas/thoughts**." 

### Action
*   Engaging in mental processes or recreational/experimental activities.

Example::	*A **pai** ne sun.* = "I **think/contemplate** about knowledge."
Example::	*E **pai** se o pene ku?* = "Do you **think/feel** (subjectively) it is good?"


Example::	*Neko ta **pai**.* = "The cat **plays/thinks** (in its cat way)." 
// Needs context; could be chasing a toy or intently watching something.


Example::	*An **pai** ne wai.* = "We **play/experiment** in the water."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something related to the mind, subjectivity, playfulness, fun, or the quantity six.

Example::	*Neko o **pai**.* = "The cat is **thoughtful/playful**." 
// Again, highly context-dependent.

// Could be intense thought, strong joy, or focused play.


Example::	*A hat **si pai** ko.* = "I have **six** lifeforms." 
// Numerical meaning is usually clear with 'si' or context.


Example::	*Sisi a **pai**.* = "One **six**." (Meaning 16)
