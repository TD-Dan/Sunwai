# USI

IPA::				/Ëˆu.si/
Marker::		**Conditional Marker ("if")**
Concept::		**Hypothetical Condition, Contingency**
Action::		**To make conditional, hypothesize**
Descriptor::	**Conditional, Hypothetical**

> A **Base Set** particle primarily used as a **Marker** to introduce a conditional clause (protasis), indicating that the statement represents a hypothetical condition, assumption, or prerequisite upon which a consequent clause may depend. It signals "If..." or "Under the (uncertain) condition that...". The consequent clause (apodosis) can optionally be introduced by the marker *[[se]]* ("then", "in that case") for enhanced clarity, especially in speech.

## Usage

### Marker (Primary Use)
*   Placed at the beginning of a clause to mark it as a condition in an "if-then" structure.

Example::   ***Usi** a hat tape, se a pa ne e.* = "**If** I have food, then I give [it] to you."

Example::   ***Usi** mamasun ai, se an no ta tama.* = "**If** the sun is hot, then we do not walk."

Example::   ***Usi** e pai sun, se e toki pene.* = "**If** you think clearly, then you speak well."

Example::   ***Usi** oum o sipu, se an na lisu oum an sipu.* = "**If** everything is a system, then we need the words 'oum' and 'sipu'."

Example::   *E o pene, **usi** e o pene.* = "You are good, **if** you are good." (Tautology / Emphasizing conditionality)

### Concept (Rare/Derived Use)
*   Refers to the concept of a conditionality or a hypothetical prerequisite. Generally requires the **le** marker.

Example::   *Le **usi** o mo ne pai se.* = "The **hypothetical condition** is important in that thought process."

### Action (Rare/Derived Use)
*   To posit something as a condition. Requires **ta** marker.

Example::   *A **ta usi** le sun ro a.* = "I **posit as conditional** my knowledge." (Meaning: "My knowledge might be the condition for something else").

### Descriptor (Rare/Derived Use)
*   Describes something as being conditional or dependent on a hypothesis. Requires **so** marker.

Example::   *Se o sun so **usi**.* = "That is **conditional** knowledge."

## Compounds

*   *(None typically formed from this particle)*

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[u]]** (Uncertainty, chaos, maybe) + **[[si]]** (Rule, standard, principle, condition, law). Combines the idea of an uncertain or potential state (**u**) with the notion of it being a governing condition or rule (**si**) for a potential consequence. Signifies an "Uncertain/Potential Condition/Rule".

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Usi o tama ro pai nu.* = "'If is the path to new thought/possibilities."

Proverb:: *Ta sun usi, sunta ta sun oum.* = "Understand the condition(s), consequently understand the whole (situation)."
