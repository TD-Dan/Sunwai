Okay, let's revise the dictionary entry for **SE** to incorporate its role as an optional marker for the consequent clause ("then") in conditional structures.

# SE

IPA::				/ˈse/
Marker::		**It, That, The (referential particle/pronoun)**
Marker::		**Than (comparative particle)**
Marker::		**Then (optional conditional consequence marker)**
Concept::		**Specificity, The Referenced Item/Instance, That Point**
Action::		**To specify, point out, refer to**
Descriptor::	**Specific, Particular, Said, Aforementioned**

> A highly versatile **Base Set** particle and root. Primarily functions as a **Marker**: a neutral pronoun referring to a specific entity/concept (**it, that, the**), the core particle for comparisons (**than**), and an optional marker introducing the consequence clause in conditionals (**then**). As a concept/action, it relates to the act or idea of **specifying or referencing**.

## Usage

### Marker (Referential Pronoun/Determiner)
*   Functions like a pronoun, referring to a previously established or contextually clear entity, concept, or situation. Gender-neutral. Can sometimes act like a definite article ("the specific one").

Example::   *Neko o pene. **Se** o li.* = "The cat is beautiful. **It** is small."

Example::   ***Se** o sun ro a.* = "**That is** my knowledge."

Example::   *A pai **se** lisu.* = "I think about **that/the specific** word."

### Marker (Comparative "than")
*   Used after the quality/descriptor in comparisons to introduce the standard being compared against.

Example::   *Neko o li inuko **se**.* = "The cat is smaller **than** the dog."

Example::   *Mo **se** e.* = "Bigger **than** you."

### Marker (Conditional Consequence "then" - Optional)
*   Optionally introduces the main clause (apodosis) in a conditional sentence, following a condition marked by *[[Usi]]*. It adds clarity, especially in spoken language.

Example::   *Usi a hat tape, **se** a pa ne e.* = "If I have food, **then** I give [it] to you."

Example::   *Usi tilon o pene, **se** an wai.* = "If the time is good, **then** we flow/go."

Example::   *Usi e sun, **se** toki.* = "If you understand, **then** speak." (Marker optional but adds flow).

### Concept
*   The idea of specificity, the exact item being discussed, or "that particular point/case." Often requires **le**.

Example::   *A pai le **se**.* = "I think about **that specific point/instance**."

Example::   *Le **se** ro toki o mo.* = "The **specificity/that exact point** of the speech is important."

### Action
*   The act of making something specific, pointing it out, or referring to it pointedly. Requires **ta**.

Example::   *A **ta se** le sun nu.* = "I **specify/refer to** the new knowledge."

Example::   ***Ta se** le lisu!* = "**Point out/Specify** the word!"

### Descriptor
*   Modifies a noun to mean "that specific one," "the particular one mentioned," or "aforementioned." Often requires **so**.

Example::   *A hat heim **so se**.* = "I have **that specific** home (we discussed)."

Example::   *Lisu **so se** o u.* = "**The aforementioned** word is uncertain."

## Compounds
*   **[[Seno]]** (**se** + **[[no]]**): Zero, nothingness ("that which is not," "the non-specific thing").

## Origin
*   **Wolof**: *ci* ("at, than") - Comparative inspiration.
*   **Japanese**: より (_yori_, "than") - Structural similarity in comparison.
*   **Latin**: _sē_ ("itself/themselves") - Reference inspiration.


## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Se o se.* = "That is that." / "It is specific."

Proverb:: *Usi sun, se ta.* = "If (there is) clarity/understanding, then act."
