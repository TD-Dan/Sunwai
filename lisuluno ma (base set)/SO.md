# SO
IPA::				/Ëˆso/
Marker::		**Descriptor marker (adjective/adverb)**
Concept::		**Stability, stillness, stasis, calm, balance (static)**
Action::		**To stabilize, to become still, to calm down, to remain unchanged**
Descriptor::	**Stable, still, static, calm, balanced (static)**

> Primarily an optional particle used to explicitly mark the following word as a descriptor (adjective/adverb). Secondarily, represents the concept of stability, stillness, or static balance, contrasting with TA (movement) and U (chaos).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Precedes a word to signal its function as a descriptor, modifying either a concept (noun) or an action (verb). *This is usually the default interpretation unless context strongly implies the 'Stability' meaning.*

Example::	***So** mo neko o pene.* = "The **big** cat is beautiful." - 'so' functions purely as a marker for 'mo'.

Example::	*A ta pai **so** pene.* = "I think **well / beautifully**." - 'so' functions purely as a marker for 'pene'.

### Concept
*   Refers to the state of being stable, unchanging, or calm.

Example::	*Le **so** o pene.* = "The **stillness/calm** is good." - 'le' marks 'so' as the concept noun.

Example::	*A pai **so**.* = "I think about **stability**." / "My thought is **stillness**."
- Ambiguous - could mean "I think calmly" (see Action/Descriptor).

### Action
*   The act of becoming or making stable or still.

Example::	*Wai **ta so**.* = "The water **becomes still / stabilizes**."

Example::	*A **ta so** le pai.* = "I **stabilize/calm** the mind."

### Descriptor
*   Describes a state of being stable, still, or calm. *Can sometimes overlap with Marker usage if 'so' is the descriptor being marked.*

Example::	*A o **so**.* = "I am **stable/still/calm**." - Here 'so' itself functions as the descriptor linked by 'o'.

Example::	*Sipu **so** o pene.* = "A **stable** system is good." - Here 'so' acts as an adjective describing 'sipu'.

Example::	*A hat **so so** pai.* = "I have a **very stable/calm** mind." - Reduplication for emphasis. `so` marks `so`.
