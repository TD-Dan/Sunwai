# TILON

IPA::				/ˈtiː.lon/
Concept::		**Time, Duration; Temporal Rhythm, Temporal Cycle, Temporal Pattern**
Action::		**To time, to pace; To occur in temporal cycles/rhythmically; To last, endure (for a duration)**
Descriptor::	**Temporal, Related to time; Temporally Rhythmic, Temporally Cyclical, Temporally Patterned**

> Root representing the concept of **time, its passage (duration), and recurring patterns or rhythms specifically *within* time.** It is the temporal framework itself. Systematically derived from [[TI]] (Interval/Rhythm) + [[LON]] (Length/Duration). Contrasts with [[PI]] (cycle in any domain).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to time itself, a specific duration, or a recurring temporal pattern.

Example:: *Tilon wai!* = "Time flows!"
Example:: *A hat tilon.* = "I have time."
Example:: *Le **tilon** ro ouman o pi.* = "The **temporal cycle** of humanity is cyclical." (*le* specifies Concept).
Example:: *An pai le **tilon** li.* = "We think about the short **duration**."
Example:: *Pi ro ma o **tilon** lo.* = "The cycle (orbit) of the Earth is a long **time/duration**."

### Action
*   The act of measuring time, pacing actions temporally, occurring rhythmically over time, or lasting for a specific duration.

Example:: *Tiko ta **tilon**.* = "The heart **beats rhythmically/keeps time**."
Example:: *Ta **tilon** le ta!* = "**Pace** the action (over time)!"
Example:: *Se **tilon** lo.* = "It **lasts/endures** long (over time)."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as relating to time, duration, or being rhythmically/cyclically patterned *in time*.

Example:: *Ouman o ko **so tilon**.* = "Humanity is a **temporal** being."
Example:: *Pu o **tilon**.* = "The form is **temporally cyclical/rhythmic**."
Example:: *Se o sun **so tilon**.* = "That is **time-related/temporal** knowledge."

## Compounds

*   [[NUTILON]] = Future (*[[NU]]* + *tilon* = "following/next time").
*   [[Ketilon]] = Past (*[[KE]]* + *tilon* = "preceding time").
*   [[Tilonpene]] = Good timing, festival, auspicious time (*tilon* + *[[PENE]]* = "good/beautiful time").
*   [[Tilonheim]] = Clock, calendar, place of timekeeping (*tilon* + *[[HEIM]]* = "time home/center/object").
*   [[Senotilon]] = Timelessness, eternity (*[[SENO]]* + *tilon* = "no time").
*   [[Tapetilon]] = Mealtime (*[[TAPE]]* + *tilon* = "food time").
*   [[Tilonta]] = Journey, travel (experience of moving through time) (*tilon* + *[[TA]]* = "time action/movement").
*   [[Tilonli]] = Moment, instant (*tilon* + *[[LI]]* = "small time").
*   [[Tilonsi]] = Schedule, time standard, measured time (*tilon* + *[[SI]]* = "time measure/rule").

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: **[[TI]]** (Interval, repetition, rhythm) + **[[LON]]** (Length, duration, extension). Represents the extension (*LO*) of intervals (*TI*) through time.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ouman o tilon.* = "Humanity is (bound by) time / is a cycle."

Proverb:: *Oum wai ne tilon.* = "Everything flows in time."
