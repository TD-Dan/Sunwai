IPA::				/ˈɑ.pɑ/

> A core root representing the action of an agent bringing something (an object, concept, opportunity, or responsibility) into their own possession, control, or sphere of activity. It implies a transfer, selection, or engagement directed towards or centered on the self (*[A](A.md)*). Derived from *[A](A.md)* (Self, Here, Actual, Observer) and *[PA](PA.md)* (Give, Offer, Provide), conceptually "giving to self" or "actualizing a transfer/commitment to self." Contrasts with *[PA](PA.md)* (to give away from self).
