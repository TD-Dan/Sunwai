# KE

IPA::				/Ëˆke/
Concept::		**Precedence, Antecedence; The Past, That Which Came Before; Former State**
Action::		**To precede, come before, antecede; To be former/past**
Descriptor::	**Preceding, Prior, Former, Antecedent, Previous, Old (by implication of coming before)**

> Root indicating something that comes *before* something else in sequence, time, or spatial arrangement. Represents the past or a former state relative to the present or another reference point. Contrasts with [[NU]] (following, next).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to that which came before, a precedent, the past, or a former state. 

Example::   *Le **ke** o sun.* = "The **precedent / past** is knowledge."
Example::   *A luno **ke**.* = "I remember the **past / what came before**."
Example::   ***Ke** hat pene an u.* = "The **past** has beauty and chaos."
Example::   *Le **ke** ro e o luno a.* = "Your **former state / who you were before** is my memory."

### Action
*   The act of preceding or coming before something/someone in time or sequence. Often requires [[TA]].

Example::   *A **ke** e.* = "I **precede** you." / "I came **before** you."
Example::   *Le sun se **ta ke** le pai se.* = "That knowledge **precedes** that thought."
Example::   *Mama **ke** mama.* = "Parents **come before** parents." (Generational precedence).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being earlier in time or sequence; prior or former. Can imply "old" through context. Reduplication `ke ke` emphasizes significant precedence (ancient, long past), or previous of previous (-2)

Example::   *Se o pu **ke**.* = "That is the **preceding/prior/former** form."
Example::   *E o ouman **ke** ro maheim an.* = "You are a **former** person of our homeland."
Example::   *Le **ke ke** ouman o sun.* = "The **very ancient** (lit. preceding-preceding) person is wise."
Example::   *A hat tape **ne ke**.* = "I had food **before / in the past**." (`ne ke` = "at a preceding time").

## Compounds
> Compounds built on the past/precedence meaning.

*   [[Keluno]] (`KE` + `[[]]`): History, Record of the Past ("preceding memory"). *(Formerly Kuluno)*.
*   [[Keko]] (`KE` + `[[KO]]`): Elder, Ancestor ("preceding lifeform"). *(Formerly Kuko)*.
*   [[Kekulo]] (`KE` + `[[KULO]]`): Faded/Old color, Patina ("past/before color"). *(Formerly Kukulo)*.
*   [[KETILO]] (`KE` + `[[TILO]]`): Past Time, Antiquity ("preceding time"). *(New, logical compound)*.
*   [[Kepu]] (`KE` + `[[PU]]`): Previous version, old model, archetype ("preceding form"). *(New, logical compound)*.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Meaning swapped with [[KU]]. Primarily gets this meaning systemically through the swap, allowing [[KU]] to align phonetically with [[U]] (Uncertainty) for its Question particle role. Direct phonetic resonance for "past/before" is less strong than for other roots, though distant conceptual links might be considered (e.g., English *keep* related to preserving the past, or the /k/ sound in sequence markers across languages).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Sun ke, o sun nu.* = "Knowing the precedent/past informs the following/future."
Proverb:: *Ke o tama ro luno.* = "The past is the road of memory."
Proverb:: *Ta ke o so.* = "To precede is to be stable (as a foundation for what follows)."

This defines `KE` in its new role. With `KU` and `KE` swapped and finalized, and `LO`/`MO`/`LI` defined, the core structural changes are set.

The next logical step would be to finalize `TILO` (Time), as it was directly affected by the `MO`->`LO` swap. Ready for `TILO`?
