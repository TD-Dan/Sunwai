# PU

IPA::					/ˈpu/
Concept::			**Form, Structure, Arrangement, Organization (physical or abstract)**
Action::			**To form, structure, arrange, organize; To craft, shape, design (physically or abstractly)**

> Root representing the deliberate or inherent **arrangement, organization, or structure** of parts into a coherent whole. This applies equally to the **physical shape** of objects (tools, art, buildings) and the **abstract structure** of concepts (language, arguments, plans, designs). Contrasts with *[[MA]]* (raw substrate) and *[[PE]]* (inherent substance/essence). It serves as a component in core concepts like *[[SIPU]]* (System = rule + structure) and *[[kipu]]* (Symbol = communication + structure).

author-comment:: PU is missing Descriptor usage
