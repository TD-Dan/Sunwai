# IPU

IPA::				/Ëˆi.pu/
Concept::		**Enclosure, Container, Cavity, Vessel, Box; Defined Space (physical or abstract); Case, Sheath; Compartment, Module**
Action::		**To enclose, encase, contain (within a defined form/space); To compartmentalize, modularize**
Descriptor::	**Enclosing, Containing (as a defined form/space), Encased, Compartmentalized, Modular**

> Represents a defined form (*[[BU]]*) characterized by having an interior space or "insideness" (*[[I]]*). It encompasses physical containers (boxes, vessels, cases) as well as abstract enclosures or defined conceptual spaces (modules, compartments, parameters of a situation). The core idea is a structure that defines an "in" separate from an "out."

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to a physical container, an enclosed space, a module, or an abstract defined area.

Example::   *A apa **ipu** tape.* = "I take the food **container**."
Example::   *Lumiako i **ipu** li.* = "The plant is in a small **pot/container**."
Example::   *Sipu se hat mu **ipu** kas.* = "That system has many different **modules/compartments**."
Example::   *Le **ipu** ro pai ro e o sun.* = "The **confines/parameters** of your thought are clear." (Abstract)
Example::   *Se o **ipu** luno.* = "That is a **memory case / archive box**."

### Action
*   To place something within an enclosure, to encase, or to define/create a distinct space/module.

Example::   *A **ta ipu** le sunlono i kipu se.* = "I **encase/put** the book in that symbol (e.g., a digital folder icon)." (Abstract action on information)
Example::   *An **ta ipu** lisu nu i sipu an.* = "We **compartmentalize/modularize** new words in our system."
Example::   *Ta **ipu** tape pae nutilon!* = "**Containerize/Box up** the food for the future!"
Example::   *Sipu se **ipu** oum ta li.* = "That system **encloses/contains** all small actions."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as enclosing, being a container, or being modular/compartmentalized.

Example::   *A hat bu **so ipu**.* = "I have an **enclosing/container-like** structure."
Example::   *Se o sipu **ipu** mo.* = "That is a big **modular/compartmentalized** system."
Example::   *Pai ro an o **ipu**.* = "Our thinking is **compartmentalized/focused within defined spaces**."

## Compounds
*   **[[Iputape]]** (*ipu* + *tape*): Food container, Lunchbox, Tupperware.
*   **[[Ipuwai]]** (*ipu* + *wai*): Water vessel, Bottle, Tank.
*   **[[Ipusun]]** (*ipu* + *sun*): Encapsulated knowledge, Module of information, Data packet.
*   **[[Ipuko]]** (*ipu* + *ko*): Cage, Pen, Terrarium, Aquarium (as an enclosing structure for life).
*   **[[Ipuheim]]** (*ipu* + *heim*): A very secure room/enclosure, Vault, Safe; "Container-Home."
*   **[[Lipu]]** (*LI*+ *ipu*, 'i' elided): Small box, Case, Small container. (Alternatively *Liipu*)
*   **[[Mopu]]** (*MO*+ *ipu*, 'i' elided): Large container, Crate, Tank. (Alternatively *Moipu*)
*   **[[Pipu]]** (*PI* + *ipu*, 'i' elided): Round container, Can, Jar, Barrel.
*   **[[Puipu]]** (*PU*+ *ipu*): Case for an item that is a form itself (e.g., a phone case, *puipu ro pikoli*).

## Distinctions

*   **vs. *PI* (Circle, Enclosure):** *PI* strongly implies a circular or cyclical enclosure. *IPU* is general for enclosures of any shape. A *Pipu* (round container) is a type of *Ipu*.
*   **vs. *HEIM* (Home, Center):** A *HEIM* is a specific type of *IPU* (enclosure) that serves as a center or dwelling for beings/activities. *IPU* is more general.
*   **vs. *PU* (Form, Structure):** An *IPU* *is* a *PU*, but specifically a *PU* defined by its interior space. Not all *PU* are *IPU* (e.g., a solid statue is a *PU* but not an *IPU*).

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **I** (In, Inside, Within, Belonging, Containment) + **PU** (Form, Structure, Arrangement, Organization). Conceptualized as "Inside-Form" or "Form-defined-by-its-Interior."

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *I ipu li, kan hat oum mo.* = "In a small container, one can hold great entirety/value."
Proverb:: *Seno ipu, wai oum.* = "Without containers/boundaries, everything flows (chaotically)."
