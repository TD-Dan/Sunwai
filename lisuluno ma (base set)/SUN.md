# SUN

IPA::				/ˈsun/
Concept::		**Illumination, Clarity, Guiding Principle, Objective Information/Knowledge (as an ideal), Understanding**
Action::		**To illuminate, clarify, understand (as alignment), orient towards truth, grasp principle**
Descriptor::	**Illuminated, Clear, Bright, Lucid, Principled, Understood (as aligned), Objective (as ideal)**

> Root representing **illumination (physical or metaphorical), clarity of understanding, and the ideal of objective knowledge or guiding principles.** It embodies the light that reveals or the insight that clarifies, distinct from subjective processing (*[[PAI]]*), stored memory (*[[LUNO]]*), or functional systems (*[[SIPU]]*). Often implies an orientation towards truth or achieving clarity, rather than complete possession for finite beings.

Example::   *Se o **sun** mo.* = "That is a vast **knowledge/clarity**."

Example::   *Seno **sun** o u.* = "Absence of **clarity/illumination** is chaos."

### Action

Example::   *E **ta** **sun** le pai ro e ku?* = "Can you **clarify / illuminate** your thought?"

Example::   *A **ta** **sun** le sipu.* = "I **grasp the principle/understanding** of the system."

Example::   *A **sun**.* = "I **understand / am clear (on this) / see the point.**"

### Descriptor
