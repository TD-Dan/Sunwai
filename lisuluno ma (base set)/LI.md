# LI

IPA::				/ˈli/
Concept::		**Smallness, Littleness, Subtlety, Minimalism; Shortness (length/duration), Brevity; Low Intensity/Scale/Degree**
Action::		**To reduce, minimize, shorten, decrease (size/intensity/scale), become small/short/brief/subtle**
Descriptor::	**Small, Little, Subtle, Minimal; Short (length/duration), Brief; Quiet, Dim, Few, Low (intensity/scale/degree)**

> Root representing the lesser pole on all scales of magnitude. It is the opposite of both [[LON]] (long, duration) and [[MO]] (big size, intensity). Covers smallness, shortness, brevity, subtlety, low intensity, fewness, quietness, dimness, etc. Neutral connotation - does not imply insignificance or powerlessness.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the quality of being small, subtle, short, brief, or low in intensity/scale. Often requires [[LE]].

Example::   *Le **li** o pene.* = "The **smallness/subtlety/brevity** is beautiful."
Example::   *Le **li** ro tilon o sun.* = "The **shortness** (duration) of the time is known."
Example::   *Le **li** ro heim o ke.* = "The **small size** of the home is past/former."
Example::   *A pai **li**.* = "I contemplate **minimalism/subtlety**."

### Action
*   To make something smaller, shorter, briefer, less intense, or to decrease its scale; or the process of becoming so. Often requires [[TA]].

Example::   *A ta **li** tape.* = "I **reduce** the food (portion)."
Example::   *Ta **li** le tilon!* = "**Shorten** the time!"
Example::   *Ta **li** le wailu!* = "**Quiet/Reduce** the sound!"
Example::   *Oum **li** ne tilon.* = "Everything **diminishes/becomes smaller/shorter** over time."

### ### Descriptor
*   Describes something as small (size), short (length/duration), brief, few, quiet, dim, low (intensity/scale/degree), subtle, etc. Reduplication `li li` emphasizes the extreme (tiny, minuscule, very brief, very quiet/dim).

Example::   *Neko o **li**.* = "The cat is **small**."
Example::   *A hat tama **li**.* = "I have/take a **short** road."
Example::   *Se o tilon **li**.* = "That was a **brief** time."
Example::   *Wailu **li li** o pene.* = "A **very quiet/faint** sound is beautiful."
Example::   *Mu ouman **li** ne heim.* = "**Few** people are in the home."
Example::   *Lumia **li** o so.* = "The **dim** light is stable."
Example::   *Se o **li** kulo.* = "That is a **subtle/pale** color."
