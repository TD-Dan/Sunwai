# MA

IPA::           /ˈmɑ/
Concept::       **Earth, Land, Soil, Ground; Physical Terrain/Location; Raw Material (unprocessed substrate); Foundation (physical or abstract basis)**
Action::        **To ground (physically/metaphorically), to root, to establish (on a base), to provide foundation**
Descriptor::    **Foundational, Ground-level, Earthen, Terrestrial**

> Core root for the **physical planet, ground, unprocessed physical substrate, and the concept of foundation or basis.** Contrasts with *[[PE]]* (inherent tangible substance/quality of a specific thing) and *[[BU]]* (formed structure). *MA* is the base upon which things rest or from which they originate.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the physical ground, landmasses, soil, specific location, unprocessed materials (like stone, clay *as substrate*), or an abstract basis/foundation.

Example::   *Neko ne **ma**.* = "The cat is on the **ground**."

Example::   *Se o **ma** pene ro oumankoma.* = "That is the beautiful **homeland/earth** of humanity."

Example::   *Le **ma** ro sipu o sun.* = "The **foundation/basis** of the system is knowledge." (Abstract basis).

Example::   *A bu ne **ma**.* = "I build/shape upon the **earth/ground**." (Using earth as the substrate/location).

### Action
*   The act of grounding something physically or metaphorically, establishing roots, setting a base, or providing foundation.

Example::   *A **ma** sipu ne sun.* = "I **ground/found** the system on knowledge."

Example::   *Lumako **ma** i wai.* = "Plants **root** in water." (Establishing their base).

Example::   *Ta **ma** le pai!* = "**Ground** the thought!" (Make it more concrete/based).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being related to earth, land, being foundational, ground-level, or made of raw/earthy material.

Example::   *Se o ko **so ma**.* = "That is an **earth-based/terrestrial** lifeform." (*so* optional).

Example::   *Sun **so ma** o pene.* = "**Foundational** knowledge is good." (*so* optional).

Example::   *A hat bu **ma**.* = "I have an **earthen/clay** structure (e.g., raw pottery)." (Focus on the raw material aspect).
