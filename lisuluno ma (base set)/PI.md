# PI

IPA::				/pi/
Concept::		**Circle, Cycle; Loop, Orbit; Enclosure**
Action::		**To circle, to cycle, to loop, to orbit; To encircle, to surround**
Descriptor::	**Circular, Cyclical, Round; Surrounding, Encompassing**
Descriptor::	**π (Pi, ~3.14159)**

> Root related to circularity, cycles, orbits, and encompassment. Also represents the mathematical constant Pi.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to a round shape, a repeating process, a cycle, or an orbit.

Example::   *Le **pi** o pene.* = "The **circle** is beautiful."

Example::   *Timo o **pi**.* = "Time is a **cycle**."

Example::   *Mapi ta **pi** ne mamasun.* = "Planets **cycle/orbit** around the sun."

Example::   ***Pi** o si mo.* = "**Pi** (the number) is an important measure."

### Action
*   To move in a circle, complete a cycle, orbit, or surround something. Can function adverbially to mean "circling" or "around" when modifying another action.

Example::   *Waku **pi** ne wai.* = "Ducks **circle** on the water."

Example::   *Ma **pi** mamasun.* = "Earth **circles/orbits** the sun."

Example::   *A **ta pi** le heim.* = "I **surround/encircle** the home."

Example::   *Neko ta pai **pi** le heim.* = "The cat plays **circling** the home / **around** the home."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as circular, round, cyclical, or surrounding. Can sometimes function adverbially.

Example::   *A hat bu **pi**.* = "I have a **round** form/structure."

Example::   *Se o sun **pi**.* = "That is **cyclical** knowledge."

Example::   *Le wai **pi** o mo.* = "The **surrounding** water is vast."

### Descriptor Pi
*   In mathematical contexts, represents Pi. Usually requires clarification with context or the `si` marker.

Example::   *Ta si le pi: **Si pi** o u 3.14.* = "Measure the circle: **Pi** is approx 3.14." (`si` marker confirms numerical use).

## Compounds

-   **[[Mapi]]** (*ma* + *pi*): Planet ("earth/land circle/orbit").
-   **[[Piwai]]** (*pi* + *wai*): Whirlpool, Vortex, Eddy ("circling water").
## Origin

-   **Greek**: Borrowed directly for the mathematical constant *π* (pi).
-   **Quechua**: Conceptual link to _p’iti_ ("to spin"), reflecting cyclical motion.
-   **Global**: Circles are a near-universal symbol of cycles, wholeness, and infinity.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Pi ro pi.* = "The cycle of cycles." / "Circle's circle." (Infinity, endless loops).
