# TOKI

IPA::				/ˈtoː.ki/
Concept::		**Language (system), speech, linguistic communication (spoken, written, signed)**
Action::		**To speak, talk, sign; to use language for communication**
Descriptor::	**Linguistic, relating to language/speech**

> Base of **structured linguistic expression** and communication (spoken, written, signed). Encompasses both the abstract **system** (language) and the **act** (speech/signing). Differentiates from the broader [[KI]] (general communication/signal/transmission).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the system of communication using words or established signs (spoken, written, signed), or the act/content of speech/signing itself.

Example:: *Le **toki** Sunwai o pene.* = "**The language** Sunwai is beautiful."

Example:: *Ouman hat **toki**.* = "Sentient beings **have language/speech**."

Example:: *Pai o **toki**.* = "Thought **is language**." (Philosophical: internal thought often uses linguistic structures).

### Action
*   The act of using a language system (speaking, writing, signing) to communicate thoughts or ideas.

Example:: *A **toki**.* = "I **speak/talk/sign**."

Example:: *E **toki** pene.* = "You **speak/talk/sign** well/beautifully."

Example:: *An **ta toki** ne sun.* = "We **talk/use language** about knowledge." 

### Descriptor
*   Describes something related to language, speech, signing, or linguistics.

Example:: *Pu **toki** o mo.* = "The **linguistic** form (e.g., grammar) **is** complex/big."

Example:: *A hat sun **so toki**.* = "I have **linguistic** knowledge."
