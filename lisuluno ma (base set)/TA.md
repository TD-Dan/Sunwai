# TA

IPA::				/ˈtɑ/
Marker::		**Action Marker**
Concept::		**Action, Change, Process, Function, Event, Dynamics**
Action::		**To act, change, process, function, operate, occur, happen, transform**
Descriptor::	**Active, Changing, Dynamic, Functional; Three (3)**

> The fundamental root for any kind of action, change, process, event, or dynamic functioning. It encompasses physical movement, state transitions, operations, exertions, and abstract processes. It represents the dynamic aspect of existence, contrasting with static states (*[[SO]]*). Also serves metaphorically as the numeral three (3).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Marks the following word to indicate its primary role as an action or verb in the sentence. This is its most common grammatical function.

Example::   *A **ta** tape.* = "I **eat**."
Example::   *Neko **ta** pai.* = "The cat **plays/thinks**."
Example::   *Sipu **ta** wailu.* = "The system **vibrates/resonates**."

### Concept
*   Refers to action, change, a process, or a dynamic event itself. Often requires *[[LE]]* for clarity as a noun.

Example::   *Le **ta** o pene.* = "The **action/process** is good."
Example::   *Oum o **ta**.* = "Everything is **change/process**."
Example::   ***Ta** wai pene.* = "**Action/Process** flows beautifully."
Example::   *A pai le **ta**.* = "I think about **action/change**."

### Action
*   To perform any action, undergo change, function, operate, or simply happen. Using *ta ta* clarifies the verb usage if context is ambiguous.

Example::   *A **ta ta** pene.* = "I **act** beautifully."
Example::   *Wai **ta ta** ne tilo.* = "Water **changes** over time."
Example::   *Piko **ta ta** ran.* = "The computer **processes/functions** quickly."
Example::   *Se **ta**.* = "It **happens/occurs**."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as active, changing, dynamic, functional, or related to the number three. Numeral use requires *[[SI]]*.

Example::   *Ko o **ta**.* = "Life is **dynamic/active**."
Example::   *A hat sipu **so ta**.* = "I have an **active/functional** system."
Example::   *An hat **si ta** heim.* = "We have **three** homes."
