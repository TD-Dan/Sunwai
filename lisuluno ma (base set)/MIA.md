# MIA

IPA::				/ˈmia/
Concept::		**Distribution, spread, pattern (esp. of potential or influence), field, wave function**
Action::		**To distribute, to spread out, to radiate (as a field/influence), to pattern**
Descriptor::	**Distributed, spread-out, field-like, patterned (like a wave or potential field)**

> Represents the concept of distribution, potential patterns, fields of influence, or how things spread out. Abstract root often used in compounds related to energy, fields, or statistical patterns.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the pattern of distribution, a field of influence, or a statistical/potential pattern.

Example::   ***Mia** ro ko o sun.* = "The **distribution** of the lifeforms is clear/known."

Example::   *Se o **mia** ro lumia.* = "That is the **pattern/field** of the light."

### Action
*   The act of spreading something out, distributing resources/influence, or radiating in a field-like manner.

Example::   *Lumia **ta mia** ne oum.* = "Light **distributes/radiates** throughout everything."

Example::   *A **ta mia** le sun.* = "I **distribute** the knowledge."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being distributed, spread out, or having the quality of a field or pattern. Often requires `[[so]]`.

Example::   *Sipu so **mia** o pene.* = "A **distributed** system is good."

Example::   *Ko so **mia** ne ma.* = "**Spread-out** lifeforms on the earth."

## Compounds

-   **[[LUMIA]]** = Light, energy (*lu + mia* = "void distribution" or "potential pattern").
-   **[[Simia]]** = Statistics, probability (*si + mia* = "measure distribution").

## Origin

-   **Conceptual**: Intended as a foundational root for describing patterns of spread, distribution, and field-like phenomena, necessary for physics and abstract descriptions. Draws abstract inspiration from scientific concepts like wave function and statistical distribution.
-   **Greek** *μοιράζω* (_moirázo_, "to distribute, divide")

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Oum hat mia.* = "Everything has patterns."
