# SI

IPA:				/ˈsi/
Marker::		**Numeral marker**
Concept::		**Rule, Law, Principle; Standard, Measure, Unit**
Action::		**To measure, quantify; To regulate (by rule), apply principles; To standardize**
Descriptor::	**Exact, Measured; Principled, Regulated**

> Represents systems of regulation, measurement, and underlying order. This includes not just quantifiable standards (*measure*, *unit*) but also the fundamental **principles, laws (natural or societal), or governing guidelines** (*rule*, *law*, *principle*) that structure behavior and interactions. It forms a core component of *[[SIPU]]* (system = rule-based structure). Primary use is as a marker for numerals; other uses often require clarification (e.g., with *le* or *ta*).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Marks explicit numerical context to resolve ambiguity.

Example::   *A hat *si* a neko.* = "I have **one** cat." (vs. *A hat a neko* = "I have my cat.")

Example::   *Tama o *si* heim.* = "The road is **four**."

Example::   *E o *si* an ku?* = "Are you **two**?"

> More examples in [[Numerical context clarification]]

### Concept
*   A system of quantification (length, time, mass), agreed norms, a fundamental truth, or a governing guideline. Often requires *le*.

Example::   *Le *si* ro mapi o sun.* = "The **principles/laws** (governing) the planets are known/clear."

Example::   *Ouman ta le *si* ro maheim.* = "Sentient beings follow **the laws/principles** of the homeland."

Example::   *Pene o le *si*.* = "Goodness is the **principle/standard**."

### Action
*   To assess value against a scale, regulate according to a system, or apply underlying principles. Often requires *ta*.

Example::   *A *ta si* neko.* = "I **measure** the cat." (Quantify)

Example::   *Timo *ta si* ouman.* = "Time **governs/regulates** humanity." (Applies principle/law)

Example::   *An *ta si* ne sun se.* = "We **apply the principle** based on that knowledge."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as conforming to a measurement, rule, or principle. Often requires *so*.

Example::   *Pu *so si* o mo.* = "The **regulated/measured** structure is big."

Example::   *Ta *so si* o pene.* = "A **principled/measured** action is good."

## Compounds

*   **[[SISI]]** = Number (*si* + *si* = "number number")
*   **[[SIPU]]** = System, Mechanism (*si* + *[[PU]]* = "rule-based structure")
*   **[[TILOSI]]** = Clock, Schedule (*[[TILON]]* + *si* = "time measured/regulated")
*   **[[SIPENE]]** = Harmony, Justice, Fairness, Golden Ratio (*si* + *[[PENE]]* = "principle/standard of beauty/goodness")
*   **[[LISUSI]]** = Grammar, Syntax; Definition (*[[LISU]]* + *si* = "word rule/principle")

## Origin

*   **Navajo**: *hashké* ("rule, law") - Conceptual resonance.
*   **French**: *Système International* (SI units) - Inspiration for measurement aspect.
*   **Latin**: *scientia* (knowledge, implying principles) - Distant conceptual link.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Si wai oum.* = "Principles/Laws flow through everything."

Proverb:: *Sun o le si.* = "Knowledge is a standard/principle."

Proverb:: *Sipu o si an pu.* = "A system is rule/principle and structure together."
