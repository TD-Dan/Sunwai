Example::   *A hat **LUNO** mo ro haitoki an.* = "I have great **memories** of our conversation."

### Action

Example::   *E **LUNO** sun se ku?* = "Do you **recall** that knowledge?"

## Distinctions
*   **vs. *[APASUN](APASUN)* (to learn/acquire knowledge):** *APASUN* is the active process of internalizing new knowledge or understanding, creating the initial imprint. *LUNO* is the faculty or act of retaining and recalling that imprint.
*   **vs. *[PAI](PAI.md)* (mind, thought process):** *PAI* is the active "workshop" of the mind for current thought, creativity, and subjective experience. *LUNO* is the mind's archive or storehouse of past experiences and learned information.
*   **vs. *[SUN](SUN.md)* (knowledge, clarity):** *SUN* is the (ideal of) objective knowledge or clarity itself. *LUNO* is the remembered/stored form of that knowledge or experience.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **LU** (Void, Emptiness, Unmanifest Potential, Openness) + **NO** (Not, Negation, Absence, Reversal of Meaning). Conceptualized as "Not-Void" or "Filled Potential" – the mental imprint or trace that makes a part of the mind's potential no longer empty but actualized with specific information or experience.
*   **External Resonance (Conceptual/Phonetic for the sound *LUNO*):**
    *   **Hawaiian**: _lono_ (a deity associated with peace, agriculture, rainfall, music – cycles and records of time/seasons are relevant to memory).
    *   **PIE Root**: Distant conceptual link to *\*men-* ("to think, remember") which gives "mind," "memory" (English), *mens* (Latin), *manas* (Sanskrit "mind"). While phonetically different, the concept of "mind-stuff" is related.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *LUNO o sun ro ketilon.* = "Memory is the knowledge/clarity of past time."
Proverb:: *Ta LUNO pene o ta apa sun nu.* = "To remember good things helps to learn new things." (Lit: "To remember good is to take new knowledge.")
Proverb:: *Seno PAI, seno LUNO. Seno LUNO, seno APASUN.* = "Without mind/thought, no memory. Without memory, no (basis for new) learning."
Proverb:: *LUNO ro A o no SUN; LUNO o LU so NO.* = "My memory is not (objective) Truth/Clarity; memory is potential made 'not-void' (actualized/imprinted)."
Proverb:: *I LUNO, oum ko kan o nu.* = "In memory, all lifeforms can be new/re-experienced."
