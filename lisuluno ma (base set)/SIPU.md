# SIPU

IPA::				/Ëˆsi.pu/
Concept::		**System, Mechanism, Functional Structure, Organization, Network**
Action::		**To function (systematically), operate (as system), organize, structure functionally**
Descriptor::	**Systemic, Systematic, Functional, Structural, Organized, Mechanical, Networked**

> Represents a coherent whole composed of interconnected or interdependent parts acting according to rules or principles (`[[si]]`) within a specific structure or arrangement (`[[pu]]`). This core **Base Set** compound applies broadly to physical/natural systems (machines, ecosystems, organisms), abstract systems (language, logic, mathematics), and social systems (organizations, networks). While defined by its rule-based structure, `sipu` inherently implies a potential or actual function, process, or equilibrium state (`[[ta]]`).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the system, mechanism, organization, or functional structure itself.

Example::   *Le **sipu** ro toki o mo.* = "The **system** of language is complex."

Example::   *Mako o **sipu** pene.* = "An ecosystem is a beautiful **system**."

Example::   *A pai le **sipu**.* = "I think about the **system**."

Example::   *Se o **sipu** li.* = "That is a small **mechanism/system**."

Example::   *Piko o **sipu** sun.* = "A computer is a **system** for knowledge/information." (`piko` assumed defined)

### Action
*   The act of functioning as a system, operating mechanically/biologically, organizing functionally, or interacting according to systemic rules. The action marker `ta` can optionally clarify verb usage.

Example::   *Ko **ta sipu** mo.* = "The body **functions systematically** in a complex way." (`ta` clarifies Action).

Example::   *Maheim **sipu** ne sun.* = "The nation **is organized** around knowledge." (Implied systemic functioning).

Example::   *Piko **ta sipu** ran.* = "The computer **operates/processes** quickly."

Example::   *Ta **sipu** le lisu!* = "**Organize** the words!"

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being related to a system, being systematic, organized, functional in structure, or mechanical. The descriptor marker `so` can optionally clarify adjective/adverb usage.

Example::   *Se o pai **so sipu**.* = "That is a **systematic** thought." (`so` optional).

Example::   *A hat bu **sipu**.* = "I have a **functional/system-like** structure."

Example::   *An toki **so sipu**.* = "We speak **systematically/in an organized way**."

Example::   *Oum ko o **sipu**.* = "All life **is systemic**." (Life functions as complex systems).

## Compounds

*   **[[tokisipu]]** (`[[toki]]` + `sipu`): Language System, Grammar
*   **[[kosipu]]** (`[[ko]]` + `sipu`): Biological System (e.g., nervous system)
*   **[[masipu]]** (`[[ma]]` + `sipu`): Geological System, Planetary System
*   **[[mapisipu]]** (`[[mapi]]` + `sipu`): Planetary System
*   **[[paisipu]]** (`[[pai]]` + `sipu`): Logical System, Mental Model, Strategy
*   **[[siputa]]** (`sipu` + `[[ta]]`): Operating System, Active Mechanism, Functional Process
*   **[[sipusun]]** (`sipu` + `[[sun]]`): Systems Theory, Cybernetics, Knowledge of Systems
## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[SI]]** (Measure, unit, standard, rule, law, principle) + **[[BU]]** (Form, Structure, Arrangement, Organization - physical or abstract). It signifies a "Rule-based/Principled Structure," forming the foundation for understanding how diverse systems function.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Sipu o si an pu.* = "A system is rule/principle and structure/form together."
