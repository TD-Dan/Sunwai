# HAT

IPA::				/ˈhɑt/
Concept::		**Possession, Ownership, Containing, Having**
Action::		**To have, to possess, to hold, to contain**
Descriptor::	**Having, Possessed, Containing**

> Core root primarily functioning as the verb "to have," indicating possession, ownership, or containment. Contrasts with the particle `[[RO]]` which marks belonging ('s, of).

## Usage

### Action
*   The primary function: signifies having, possessing, or containing something.

Example::   *A **hat** heim.* = "I **have** a home."

Example::   *Neko **hat** tape.* = "The cat **has** food."

Example::   *Heim **hat** ouman mu.* = "The home **contains/has** many people."

Example::   *E **hat** a ku?* = "Do you **have/hold** me?" (Can imply support: "Do you have my back?").

### Concept
*   Refers to the state or concept of possession or having something. Usually requires `[[le]]`.

Example::   *Le **hat** o sun.* = "The **concept of having/possession** is knowledge." (Philosophical).

Example::   ***Hat** tape o pene.* = "**Having** food is good." (Using `hat` as a gerund-like concept).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as possessing a quality, being owned, or containing something. Often used predicatively or with `so`.

Example::   *Se o heim **so hat** pene.* = "That is a home **having** beauty." (`so hat` optionally clarifies `hat` describes `heim`).

Example::   *Le bu so **hat** wai o mo.* = "The container **holding** water is big." (Lit: "The form having water...").

Example::   *A o **hat** sun.* = "I **am having** knowledge." (I possess knowledge).
