# KA

IPA::				/Ààk…ë/
Concept::		**Midpoint, balance point, pivot, center (dynamic), crux**
Action::		**To center, to pivot, to mediate, to balance (dynamically)**
Descriptor::	**Central, pivotal, halfway, mediating, balanced (dynamic), five (5)**

> Represents the number five (5). Conceptually, it also embodies the idea of a midpoint, a dynamic balance point, or a pivot ‚Äì a central point around which things turn or are mediated. Contrasts with [[O]] (static equality/balance) and [[SO]] (stillness/stability). 

## Usage

### Descriptor (Numeral)
*   Primary usage: Represents the quantity 5. 

Example::	*A hat **si ka** ko.* = "I have **five** lifeforms."
Example::	*Sisi a **ka**.* = "One **five**." (Meaning 15)
Example::	*Si **ka ti**.* = "**Five times**." 

### Concept
*   Refers to a central point, pivot, midpoint, or the crux of a matter. 

Example::	*Se o **ka** ro sipu.* = "That is **the pivot/center** of the system."

Example::	***Ka** o i oum.* = "The **balance point** is within everything." 

Example::	*A pai **ka**.* = "I am thinking about the **crux / midpoint**."

### Action
*   To center something, to pivot around a point, to mediate between options, or to find/create a dynamic balance.

Example::	*Ta **ka** pu.* = "**Center** the form."

Example::	*Sipu **ka** ne sun.* = "The system **pivots** on this knowledge."

Example::	*An **ka** e an e.* = "Let us **mediate** between you and you (plural/sides)."

### Descriptor (Non-Numeral)
*   Describes something as central, pivotal, halfway, mediating, or dynamically balanced.

Example::	*Sun **so ka** o mo.* = "The **central/pivotal** knowledge is important."


Example::	*Ouman o **ka** ne ata.* = "The person is **mediating** in the meeting." 

Example::	*A o **ka** i a.* = "I am **centered/balanced** within myself."
