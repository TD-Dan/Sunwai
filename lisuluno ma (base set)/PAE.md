# PAE

IPA::				/ˈpɑe/
Marker::		**Benefactive Particle ("for", "for the benefit of", "on behalf of")**
Concept::		**(Derived) Benefaction, The act/state of acting for another's benefit or representation**
Action::		**(Derived) To act for the benefit of, to represent (requires *ta*)**
Descriptor::	**(Derived) Benefactive, Representative (requires *so*)**

> A particle primarily used as a **Marker** to indicate the beneficiary of an action or the entity being represented. It signifies that the action is performed "for," "for the benefit of," or "on behalf of" the noun or pronoun that follows it. Derived from *[[PA]]* (give) + *[[E]]* (other/target).

## Usage

### Marker (Primary Use)
*   Placed after the verb and any direct object, immediately before the beneficiary noun or pronoun. Clearly distinguishes the beneficiary from the direct recipient (marked by *ne*) or possessor (*ro*).

Example::   *A ta tape **pae** e.* = "I get/make food **for** you." (Compare: *A pa tape **ne** e.* = "I give food **to** you.")

Example::   *Mama bu paitape **pae** nuko.* = "The parent makes cake **for** the offspring."

Example::   *A toki **pae** maheim.* = "I speak **on behalf of / representing** the homeland."

Example::   *E ta sipu **pae** an ku?* = "Are you building the system **for** us?"

Example::   *Pene se o **pae** oum.* = "This goodness is **for** everyone."

### Concept (Derived Use)
*   Refers abstractly to the concept of acting for another's benefit. Usually requires *[[LE]]*.

Example::   *Le **pae** o an mo.* = "The **concept of acting for others' benefit** is important togetherness."

### Action (Derived Use)
*   The act of specifically benefiting or representing someone. Requires *[[TA]]*.

Example::   *A **ta pae** e ne toki se.* = "I **am acting on your behalf** in that speech."

### Descriptor (Derived Use)
*   Describes an action or item as being for someone's benefit. Requires *[[SO]]*.

Example::   *Se o tape **so pae**.* = "That is **benefactive** food (food made for someone else)."

## Compounds

* none so far

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **PA** (Giving, Offering) + **E** (You, Other, External Target). Conceptualizes the benefactive relationship as "Giving towards the Other/Target."
*   **Conceptual Links**: Functions similarly to dative case markers indicating benefit or indirect objects in languages like Latin or German, or prepositional phrases like "for" in English.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ta pae o ta an.* = "To act for another's benefit is to act for togetherness."

Proverb:: *Lisu pae e o no lisu ro e.* = "Words spoken for you are not (necessarily) your own words."
