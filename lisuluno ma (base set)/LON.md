# LON

IPA::				/lon/
Concept::		**Length, Extension (spatial, 1D); Duration (temporal); Tallness**
Action::		**To lengthen, extend (linearly), prolong; To last, endure (over time)**
Descriptor::	**Long (length/duration), Tall, Lasting**

> Root representing linear extension in space (length, height) or extension in time (duration). Answers "how long?". Contrasts with MO (multi-dimensional size, intensity) and is the direct opposite of LI (short, brief). Replaces former root *LO*.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the quality of linear extension or duration itself. Often requires *le*.

Example::   *Le **lon** ro tama o u.* = "The **length** of the road is uncertain."
Example::   *Le **lon** ro **tilon** o li.* = "The **duration** of the time is short." *(Using new TILON)*
Example::   *A pai **lon**.* = "I contemplate **duration/length**."

### Action
*   To make something longer, taller, or to prolong its duration; or the process of lasting/enduring. Often requires *ta*.

Example::   *A ta **lon** le tama.* = "I **lengthen** the road."
Example::   *Ta **lon** le **tilon**!* = "**Prolong** the time!" *(Using new TILON)*
Example::   *Ouman **lon** ne **tilon** **lon**.* = "Humans **endure/last** for a long time." *(Using new TILON and *lon* as descriptor).*

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being long (in length or duration) or tall. Reduplication *lon lon* emphasizes extreme length/duration.

Example::   *A hat tama **lon**.* = "I have/take a **long** road."
Example::   *Ouman se o **lon**.* = "That person is **tall**."
Example::   *Se o **tilon** **lon lon**.* = "That was a **very long** time." *(Using new TILON)*
Example::   *A kutape **lon**.* = "I experience a **lasting** taste." (Focus on duration).

## Compounds

*   **[[TILON]]** (*[[TI]]* + *lon*): Time, Duration ("Extended Interval").
*   **[[KULO]]** (*[[KU]]* + *lon*, simplified): Color ("Sensed Length" -> Wavelength).
*   **[[LONTAMA]]** (*lon* + *[[TAMA]]*): Long road, highway (emphasizing length).
*   **[[LONLUNO]]** (*lon* + *[[LUNO]]*): Epic, saga, long-term memory/history ("long memory").
*   **[[LONHI]]** (*lon* + *[[HI]]*): Height, altitude ("long high").
*   **[[LONKO]]** (*lon* + *ko*): Elongated/Tall lifeform (e.g., snake, giraffe).

## Origin

*   **English**: _long_.
*   **Latin**: _longus_ ("long").
*   **Germanic**: Shared roots for "long" (e.g., German _lang_).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Tilon lon lon o senotilon.* = "A very long time is (like) no time." *(Using new TILON)*
Proverb:: *Tama lon o no tama li.* = "A long road is not a short road." (Obvious truth, highlights the opposition).
Proverb:: *Sun ro lon o sun.* = "Understanding duration/length is wisdom."
