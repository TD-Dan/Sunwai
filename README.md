# Sunwai Summary

**Sunwai** is a constructed language designed for universal communication, uniquely **blending elegant simplicity with expressive depth and practical structure**. It builds on principles from Toki Pona while enhancing grammatical precision, extendability, and artistic possibilities.

## Key Features

-   **Simplicity & Structured Depth**:
    *   **Core Vocabulary**: Around **100 core concepts** (roots & base compounds) form the foundation.
    *   **Layered Meanings**: Words gain richness by typically functioning in multiple wide roles (**Marker, Concept, Action, Descriptor**), allowing nuanced expression with minimal vocabulary.
    *   **Clear Grammar**: Small **grammatical particles** (e.g., `o`='is', `le`=concept marker, `ta`=action marker, `si`=numeral marker, `se`=than/it) provide structural clarity, enabling **flexible word order**.

-   **Accessible & Flexible Phonetics**:
    *   Uses **15 easily pronounceable letters** with standard IPA targets and defined *allowed variations* for global accessibility.
    *   Alphabet order: `A E I O U T N S K M W L H R P`.

-   **Artistic Freedom**:
    *   Pronunciation, stress, and word order can adapt to native styles or artistic intent (poetry, song).
    *   Multi-layered meanings support wordplay.
    *   Includes unique optional **typographic letter variants** (e.g., Δ, Ξ, ꓵ) for distinct visual identity.

-   **Inclusivity & Guiding Philosophy**:
    *   **Neutral by Default**: Employs gender-neutral terms (*ouman* = "sentient being") and favors **Generality over Specificity**.
    *   **Global Roots**: Borrows sounds and concepts from diverse world languages.
    *   **Ethos**: Views language as a tool for clarity and wisdom ("Language is wisdom solidified").

-   **Systematic Extendability**:
    *   Clear **rules for compounding** (e.g., *ta*+*ma* -> *tama* "road") create predictable new words.
    *   **Specialized Sets** allow for precision in technical fields (math, science, etc.).

## Core Structure & Flow

| **Aspect**          | **Details**                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Word Roles**      | Words act flexibly in multiple roles as **Marker (M)**, **Concept (C)**, **Action (A)**, or **Descriptor (D)**.         |
| **Basic Flow**      | Common sentence flow is **`Concept - Action - Concept` (C-A-C)**. Ex: *Wahiko tape paitape* (Duck eats cake).           |
| **Linking**         | Use `o` to link Concepts or assign qualities: **`Concept o Descriptor` (C o D)**. Ex: *Neko o pene* (Cat is beautiful). Other more elaborate sentence structures exists. |
| **Role Clarifiers** | Particles (`le`, `ta`, `so`, `si`, `se`, etc.) clarify word roles when needed for precision.                            |
| **Word Order**      | Flexible, but the C-A-C flow is the default for clarity without extra markers.                                          |
## Examples

Example:: *A tape.* = "I eat."
Example:: *Ouman o pene!* = "Sentient life is beautiful!"
Example:: *Neko o li se inuko.* = "The cat is smaller than the dog."
