# Lesson 2.3: Time and Process (AMA, KE, KA, NU, MAU) & The Uramako

## In this lesson:
*   **Learn core Sunwai words for time/process:** `AMA` (Start), `KE` (Past), `KA` (Present), `NU` (Future), `MAU` (End).
*   **Understand the visual sequence:** Connect these words to their representations (Sunrise → Old Rabbit → Rabbit → Baby Rabbit → Tombstone).
*   **Meet the `URAMAKO`:** Learn the word for Rabbit/Hare and its baby form, `NUKO URAMAKO`.
*   **Practice basic sentences:** Use these new words as concepts in simple `X o Y` structures (e.g., *Nu o u.* - The future is uncertain).

## Lets go!

 Hai! Neko lon an a! (Hello! Neko is long/tall and I am [small]!) We've learned about things (ko, inuko, neko). Now let's learn how to talk about when things happen. Sunwai uses simple words to show the flow of time, like the journey of our friend, Uramako!

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

*   Recognize and understand the core meanings of `AMA`, `KE`, `KA`, `NU`, and `MAU` as they relate to stages of time or processes.
*   Match these words to their symbolic visual representations in the sequence image.
*   Identify and use the word `URAMAKO` (Rabbit/Hare).
*   Recognize `NUKO` (Newborn/Offspring) and the compound `NUKO URAMAKO` (Baby Rabbit).
*   Use `AMA`, `KE`, `KA`, `NU`, `MAU`, and `URAMAKO` as nouns (Concepts) in simple "X is Y" (`X o Y`) sentences.

## The Flow of Time & Process

Sunwai uses simple, core words to represent fundamental ideas. One key set of concepts relates to the progression of time or the stages of any process – from its beginning to its end.

Let's look at a visual representation of this flow:
![spatial and temporal states](Images/spatial%20and%20temporal%20states.png)

This sequence shows:
1.  A **Sunrise**: Symbolizing the beginning.
2.  An **Ke Uramako** (Old Rabbit): Representing what came before, the past.
3.  An **Uramako** (Rabbit): Representing the current, central moment.
4.  A **Nuko Uramako** (Baby Rabbit): Representing what's next, new, the future.
5.  A **Tombstone**: Symbolizing the end or conclusion.

Now, let's learn the Sunwai words for each stage:

**1. [AMA](AMA.md) (`/ˈɑː.mɑ/`)**
    *   **Visual:** Sunrise
    *   **Keywords:** Start, Origin, Beginning
    *   **Meaning:** Represents the **start** or **origin point**. Think of the moment something commences. (*Derived from A - Observer/Here + MA - Foundation*).

**2. [KE](KE.md) (`/ˈke/`)**
    *   **Visual:** Old Uramako
    *   **Keywords:** Previous, Old, Past
    *   **Meaning:** Represents what came **before** the current moment, the **previous** stage, or simply the **past**. The old rabbit symbolizes this look backward.

**3. [KA](KA.md) (`/ˈkɑ/`)**
    *   **Visual:** Uramako (the central one)
    *   **Keywords:** Center, Current, Balance, Present
    *   **Meaning:** Represents the **present** moment, the **current** stage, or a point of **balance**. It's the "now" in the sequence. (Note: `KA` also means the number 5, but here we focus on its time/process meaning).

**4. [NU](NU.md) (`/ˈnu/`)**
    *   **Visual:** Nuko Uramako (Baby Rabbit)
    *   **Keywords:** Next, New, Future
    *   **Meaning:** Represents what comes **after** the present, the **next** step, something **new**, or the **future**. The baby rabbit (`NUKO URAMAKO`) perfectly symbolizes this potential and newness.

**5. [MAU](MAU.md) (`/maˈu/`)**
    *   **Visual:** Tombstone
    *   **Keywords:** End, Finish, Conclusion, Return
    *   **Meaning:** Represents the **end** of a process, the **finish**, or the **conclusion**, often suggesting a return to a base state or potential. (*Derived from MA - Foundation + U - Potential/Cessation*).

**Introducing Our Companion: The Uramako**

You saw the rabbit figure in several stages! The Sunwai word is:

*   **[URAMAKO](../../mo%20lisu%20(extended%20set)/URAMAKO.md) (`/ˈuː.ɾa.ma.ko/`)**: Rabbit, Hare.
    *   *(This word itself is a compound: U (Chaos/Uncertainty) + RAN (Fast) + MA (Earth) + KO (Lifeform) = "Chaotic/Skittish Fast Earth Lifeform", but you mainly need to know it means rabbit for now!)*

And for the baby rabbit representing the future (`NU` stage):

*   **[NUKO](NUKO.md) (`/ˈnuː.ko/`)**: Newborn, Offspring, Baby, Infant.
*   **[NUKO](NUKO.md) [URAMAKO](../../mo%20lisu%20(extended%20set)/URAMAKO.md) (`/ˈnuː.ko ˈuː.ɾa.ma.ko/`)**: Baby Rabbit, Young Hare.

Yes! You could also say NU URAMAKO, but we will go with NUKO URAMAKO here.

**Using These Words as Concepts**

author-comment:: needs a visualisation and more content.

In this lesson, we'll use `AMA`, `KE`, `KA`, `NU`, `MAU`, and `URAMAKO` as **Concepts** (like nouns). We can put them into the simple `X o Y` sentence structure we learned earlier, where `o` means "is" or "are".

*Example Structure:* `[Concept] o [Descriptor].`
*   `Ama o pene.` (The beginning is good.)
*   `Ke o luno.` (The past is memory.)

**The story continues**

**New Vocabulary:**

*   **AMA** `/ˈɑː.mɑ/` - Start, Origin, Beginning

## Examples

*   `Ama o pene.` = "The beginning is good."
*   `Ke o luno.` = "The past is memory."
*   `Uramako ke o mo.` = "The old rabbit is big." (Referring to the past stage)
*   `Ka o tilon a.` = "The present is my time." (Uses `tilo` - replace if needed: `Ka o pene.` = The present is good.)
*   `Uramako o ran.` = "The rabbit is fast."
*   `Nu o u.` = "The future is uncertain."
*   `Nuko uramako o li.` = "The baby rabbit is small." (Referring to the future/new stage)
*   `Mau o li.` = "The end is small / brief."
*   `Uramako no o KE.` = "The rabbit is not the past." (Using `no`)

## Exercises
