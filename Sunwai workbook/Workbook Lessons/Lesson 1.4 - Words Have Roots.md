# **Lesson 1.4: Words Have Roots (Compounding and the Root KO)**

## In this lesson:

*   **Discover word origins:** Learn about "root words" in Sunwai.
*   **Unlock word building:** Understand the basic idea of compounding.
*   **Meet the root `KO`:** The word for life itself!
*   **Learn a new creature: `INUKO` (Dog)!**
*   **Practice with lifeforms** using `KO` and `INUKO`.

## Lets go!

*Hai! Neko o a!* (Hello! It's me, Neko!) In the last lesson, we saw that Sunwai words can have different roles (Concept, Action, Descriptor, Marker). But where do these words come from? Most Sunwai words aren't created from scratch – they are built by combining simpler **root words**. It's like building with blocks! Today, we'll learn about this idea, called **compounding**, and meet a very important root: `KO`!

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

*   Understand the difference between a "root word" and a "compound word" in Sunwai.
*   Recognize that compounding is the main way Sunwai vocabulary expands.
*   Know the meaning and basic use of the root word `KO` (lifeform).
*   Know the meaning and basic use of the compound word `INUKO` (dog).
*   Identify the roots within the compound word `INUKO`.
*   Use `KO` and `INUKO` as Concepts (nouns) in simple sentences.

## Roots and Compounds (Sun Lisu an Lisu An)

Think of Sunwai vocabulary like a garden:

1.  **Root Words (Sun Lisu):** These are the basic seeds. They are often short, simple words representing fundamental concepts. We've already seen some!
    *   Examples: `sun` (clarity), `wai` (water/flow), `ma` (earth), `li` (small), `ta` (action), `pene` (good).
2.  **Compound Words (Lisu An):** These are the plants that grow from combining the seeds! Most words in Sunwai are compounds, built by joining two or more root words (or even other compounds). This makes the vocabulary logical and connected.
    *   Example: The name of our language, `Sunwai`, is a compound!
        *   `SUN` (clarity/wisdom) + `WAI` (flow/change) = **`Sunwai`** (Flow of clarity/wisdom)

Understanding compounding helps you guess the meaning of new words!

## Meeting the Root: `KO` (Lifeform)

Let's learn a crucial root word:

*   **`KO` (`/ko/`)**
    *   **Meaning:** Lifeform, biological being, body.
    *   **Usage:** This is a very general term for *any* living thing – plants, animals, microbes, even potentially `oumanuma` (aliens)! It focuses on the biological aspect of existence.

**Examples:**

*   `Ko o pene.` = "Life / Biological existence is good."
*   `A o ko.` = "I am a lifeform." (Stating a biological fact)
*   `Ma hat ko.` = "The earth has lifeforms."

You might recognize `KO` from my name!

*   `Neko` (Cat) is a compound: `NE` (nine) + `KO` (lifeform) = "Nine-lifeform" (referencing the myth about cats having nine lives!).

## A New Compound: `INUKO` (Dog)

Now let's build another lifeform word using compounding:

*   **`INUKO` (`/ˈi.nu.ko/`)**
    *   **Meaning:** Dog, Canine.
    *   **Structure:** This word comes from combining other Sunwai concepts:
        *   `I` (in/inside) + `NUKO` (newborn/offspring) = **`INUKO`**
    *   **Concept:** The idea behind this compound is that dogs are often seen as being perpetually "inside" the family or pack, or having a loyal, dependent nature like an "offspring" (`nuko`). It's a conceptual way to build the word, different from the `Neko` structure.

**Examples:**

*   `Inuko o ko.` = "A dog is a lifeform."
*   `Le inuko o mo.` = "The dog is big." (Using `le` to mark `inuko` clearly as the subject Concept)
*   `A hat inuko.` = "I have a dog."
*   `Inuko o no neko.` = "A dog is not a cat."

## Vocabulary Summary

**New Vocabulary:**

*   **KO** `/ko/` - Lifeform, biological being, body
*   **INUKO** `/ˈi.nu.ko/` - Dog, Canine
*   **NUKO** `/ˈnuː.ko/` - Newborn, Offspring, Baby (Seen as part of `INUKO`'s origin)

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Root Word (Sun Lisu):** Basic building block word.
*   **Compound Word (Lisu An):** Word made by combining roots.

**Review Vocabulary:**

*   `o` - is, are
*   `pene` - good, beautiful
*   `neko` - cat
*   `i` - in, inside
*   `nu` - next, new
*   `ne` - nine; on, at
*   `le` - concept marker
*   `mo` - big
*   `li` - small
*   `ma` - earth, ground
*   `no` - not
*   `hat` - to have

## More Examples

*   `A o ko.` = "I am a lifeform."
*   `E o ko.` = "You are a lifeform."
*   `Neko o ko li.` = "A cat is a small lifeform."
*   `Inuko o ko mo.` = "A dog is a big lifeform."
*   `A hat neko an inuko.` = "I have a cat and a dog." (Using `an` = and)
*   `Le inuko ro a o pene.` = "My dog (the dog of me) is good." (Using `ro` = possessive)
*   `Ko o no lisu.` = "A lifeform is not (just) a word."

## Exercises

**1. Match Word Type:** Label each word as a "Root" or a "Compound".
    *   `ko` -> ______
    *   `inuko` -> ______
    *   `ma` -> ______
    *   `sunwai` -> ______
    *   `neko` -> ______
    *   `i` -> ______

**2. Root Finding:** Which word below contains the root `KO`?
    *   A) `kulo` (color)
    *   B) `neko` (cat)
    *   C) `toki` (language)
    *   D) `kas` (but/separate)

**3. Compound Structure:** What are the main parts (roots) that make up the word `INUKO`?
    *   ____________ + ____________ = `INUKO`

**4. Fill-in-the-Blanks:** Choose the best word (`ko`, `inuko`, `neko`) to complete the sentence.
    *   `Oum ______ o pene.` (All lifeforms are good.)
    *   `Le ______ ro a o mo.` (My dog is big.)
    *   `Se li ______ o no ______ mo.` (That small cat is not a big dog.)

**5. Simple Translation (Sunwai -> English):**
    *   `Inuko o ko.`
    *   `A hat ere ko.` (Using `ere` = two)
    *   `Ko o no sun.`
    *   `Le neko li o no inuko.`

**6. Simple Translation (English -> Sunwai):**
    *   A dog is beautiful.
    *   Life is good.
    *   I have a small dog.
    *   A cat is a lifeform.

*Pene ran!* (Fast good! / Well done!) You've learned about the building blocks of Sunwai vocabulary – roots and compounds – and met the essential root `KO` and our canine friend `INUKO`. Seeing how words connect helps unlock the logic and beauty of the language.

In the next lesson, we'll take a quick look at a practical challenge: How do we talk about people and places whose names don't follow Sunwai rules? --> [[Lesson 1.5 - Names Have Homes Too]]
