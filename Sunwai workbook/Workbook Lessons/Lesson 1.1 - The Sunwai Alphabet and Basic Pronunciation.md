## Lets go!

*Hai!* (Hello!) I'm Neko, and I'll be helping you learn Sunwai. Don't worry, Sunwai is designed to be easy and fun, like `pai` (play)! One of the best parts is that it only uses 15 letters with sounds common across many languages. Let's start there!

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

*   Recognize all 15 Sunwai letters.
*   Identify the 5 vowels and 10 consonants.
*   Pronounce the basic sound of each letter using the standard IPA guide.
*   Read and pronounce a few simple Sunwai words.

## The Sunwai Alphabet (Sunwai Kiputo)

Sunwai uses these 15 letters, ordered by sound type:

**AEIOU TNSKM WLHRP**

Let's break them down:

**Vowels (5):** These are the open sounds that form the core of syllables.
`A E I O U`

**Consonants (10):** These sounds shape the vowels. They are grouped by how common they are:
*   Common: `T N S K M`
*   Less Common: `W L H R P`

**Easy Way to Remember the Order:**

You can learn the order with a little chant! The consonant names combine the letter with a common vowel:

*   **A E I O U** (Vowels)
*   **TA NE SI KO MU** (Common Consonants)
*   **WAI LE HI RO PU** (Less Common Consonants)

## Basic Pronunciation (Toki Lisu)

Sunwai is flexible, but here are the standard sounds. Don't worry about perfection – clarity and consistency are key! Using your native pronunciation is often okay, especially when learning.

**Vowels**

| Letter  | Standard IPA | Like English... (approx.)      |
| :------ | :----------- | :----------------------------- |
| **A a** | **/ɑ/**      | f**a**ther, p**a**lm           |
| **E e** | **/e/**      | b**e**d, h**ey** (but shorter) |
| **I i** | **/i/**      | s**ee**, mach**i**ne           |
| **O o** | **/o/**      | g**o**, b**oa**t               |
| **U u** | **/u/**      | b**oo**t, fl**u**te            |

**Consonants**

| Letter  | Name | Standard IPA | Like English... (approx.) | Notes                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------ | :--- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T t** | TA   | **/t/**      | **t**op, **t**en          | Clear 't' sound.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **N n** | NE   | **/n/**      | **n**et, fu**n**          | Standard 'n'.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **S s** | SI   | **/s/**      | **s**ee, pa**ss**         | Clear 's'. Can be like 'sh' sometimes, flexibility allowed.                                                                                                      |
| **K k** | KO   | **/k/**      | **k**ite, **c**at         | Crisp 'k' sound.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **M m** | MU   | **/m/**      | **m**an, ha**m**          | Standard 'm'.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **W w** | WAI  | **/w/**      | **w**et, **w**in          | Like English 'w'. Can sometimes sound like 'v' based on speaker preference.                                                                                      |
| **L l** | LE   | **/l/**      | **l**ake, fo**ll**ow      | Clear 'l'. (Speakers who naturally use 'r' for 'l' can often use a flap sound).                                                                                  |
| **H h** | HI   | **/h/**      | **h**at, a**h**ead        | A breathy 'h'. Avoid making it too harsh like German 'ch' unless for specific artistic effect.                                                                   |
| **R r** | RO   | **/ɾ/**      | bu**tt**er, la**dd**er    | **This is a flap**, like the 't' in American English "water" or the single 'r' in Spanish "pero". It's NOT a rolled 'r' or the English 'r'.                      |
| **P p** | PU   | **/b/**      | **b**oy, **b**ed          | **Standard sound is 'b'**. Using a 'p' sound (like *pot*) is an allowed variation. We write 'p' for simplicity and international recognition, but pronounce 'b'. |

***Key Point:** Sunwai pronunciation allows for artistic freedom. You might hear slight variations. Focus on being understood.*

## Vocabulary Introduced

These are some of the first words you'll encounter, using the letters we just learned:

*   `Sunwai` `/ˈsun.wɑi/` - The name of the language!
*   `toki` `/ˈtoː.ki/` - language, speech, to speak
*   `sun` `/ˈsun/` - clarity, wisdom, **knowledge**, sun
*   `a` `/ˈɑ/` - **I/me**; here; to observe; real
*   `e` `/ˈe/` - **you**; it/that; external; to interact
*   `o` `/ˈo/` - **is**, are; to be
*   `Neko` `/ˈneː.ko/` - Cat (That's me!)
*   `Hai` `/ˈhɑi/` - Hello! Yes!

## Examples

Let's see how the letters build these words:

*   `S + u + n + w + a + i` -> **Sunwai**
*   `t + o + k + i` -> **toki**
*   `s + u + n` -> **sun**
*   `a` -> **a**
*   `e` -> **e**
*   `o` -> **o**
*   `N + e + k + o` -> **Neko**
*   `H + a + i` -> **Hai**

*Pene!* (Good!) You've learned the building blocks of Sunwai sounds. Remembering the flexibility and the core sounds is the most important step. Don't stress too much about getting the `/ɾ/` flap perfect right away!

In the next lesson, we'll see how these letters combine into syllables, the chunks that make up words.
