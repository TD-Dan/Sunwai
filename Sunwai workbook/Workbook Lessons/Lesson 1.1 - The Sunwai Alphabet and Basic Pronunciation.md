*Hai!* (Hello!) I'm Neko, and I'll be helping you learn Sunwai. Don't worry, Sunwai is designed to be easy and fun, like `pai` (play)! One of the best parts is that it only uses 15 letters with sounds common across many languages. Let's start there!

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

*   Recognize all 15 Sunwai letters.
*   Identify the 5 vowels and 10 consonants.
*   Pronounce the basic sound of each letter using the standard IPA guide.
*   Read and pronounce a few simple Sunwai words.

## The Sunwai Alphabet (Sunwai Kiputo)

Sunwai uses these 15 letters, ordered by sound type:

**AEIOU TNSKM WLHRP**

Let's break them down:

**Vowels (5):** These are the open sounds that form the core of syllables.
`A E I O U`

**Consonants (10):** These sounds shape the vowels. They are grouped by how common they are:
*   Common: `T N S K M`
*   Less Common: `W L H R P`

**Easy Way to Remember the Order:**

You can learn the order with a little chant! The consonant names combine the letter with a common vowel:

**A E I O U** ! -  **TA NE SI KO MU** ! - **WAI LE HI RO PU** !

Try it out and create your own melody!

## Basic Pronunciation (Lisuwailu)

Sunwai is flexible, but here are the standard sounds. Don't worry about perfection – clarity and consistency are key! Using your native pronunciation is often okay, especially when learning.

**Vowels**

| Letter  | Standard IPA | Like English... (approx.)      |
| :------ | :----------- | :----------------------------- |

| **U u** | **/u/**      | b**oo**t, fl**u**te            |

**Consonants**

| Letter  | Name | Standard IPA | Like English... (approx.) | Notes                                                                                             |
| :------ | :--- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **T t** | TA   | **/t/**      | **t**op, **t**en          | Clear 't' sound.                                                                                  |
| **N n** | NE   | **/n/**      | **n**et, fu**n**          | Standard 'n'.                                                                                     |
| **S s** | SI   | **/s/**      | **s**ee, pa**ss**         | Clear 's'. Can be like 'sh' sometimes, flexibility allowed.                                       |
| **K k** | KO   | **/k/**      | **k**ite, **c**at         | Crisp 'k' sound.                                                                                  |
| **M m** | MU   | **/m/**      | **m**an, ha**m**          | Standard 'm'.                                                                                     |
| **W w** | WAI  | **/w/**      | **w**et, **w**in          | Like English 'w'. Can sometimes sound like 'v' based on speaker preference.                       |
| **L l** | LE   | **/l/**      | **l**ake, fo**ll**ow      | Clear 'l'. (Speakers who naturally use 'r' for 'l' can often use a flap sound).                   |
| **H h** | HI   | **/h/**      | **h**at, a**h**ead        | A breathy 'h'. Avoid making it too harsh like German 'ch' unless for specific artistic effect.    |
| **R r** | RO   | **/ɾ/**      | butte**r**, ladde**r**    | **This is a flap**, like the 't' in American English "water" or the single 'r' in Spanish "pero". |
| **B b** | BU   | **/b/**      | **b**oy, **b**ed          | **Standard sound is 'b'**. Using a 'p' sound (like *pot*) is an allowed variation.                |

***Key Point:** Sunwai pronunciation allows for artistic freedom. You might hear slight variations. Focus on being understood.*
