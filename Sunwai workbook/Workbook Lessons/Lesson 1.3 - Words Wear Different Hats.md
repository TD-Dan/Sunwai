# Lesson 1.3: Words Wear Different Hats (M, C, A, D)

## In this lesson:

*   **Discover Sunwai's flexibility:** Learn that one word can often do different jobs!
*   **Meet the Four Roles:** Concept (C), Action (A), Descriptor (D), and Marker (M).
*   **See words change roles:** Look at examples like `wai` (water/flow) and `pene` (good/beauty).
*   **Understand context is key:** How sentence position often tells you a word's role.
*   **Preview clarifying tools:** A first peek at Markers like `le`, `ta`, `so`.

## Lets go!

*Hai!* Neko again! So far, we've learned the sounds and how they build syllables and words. Now for something really cool and powerful about Sunwai: **words are flexible!** Unlike many languages where a word is strictly a noun *or* a verb, a single Sunwai word can often wear different "hats" depending on how it's used in a sentence. This makes the language efficient and poetic!

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

*   Explain that Sunwai words can often have multiple roles.
*   List the four main roles: Concept (C), Action (A), Descriptor (D), and Marker (M).
*   Identify the *potential* roles a word might have based on its meaning.
*   Understand that context (like sentence position) usually clarifies a word's current role.
*   Recognize that special "Marker" words exist to make roles explicit when needed.

## The Four Roles: C, A, D, M

Most Sunwai words can function in up to four main ways. Think of these as the jobs a word can do:

1.  **Concept (C):** Like a **Noun**. Refers to a thing, idea, place, or being.
    *   Examples: `neko` (cat), `heim` (home), `sun` (clarity/knowledge), `wai` (water), `ma` (earth).

2.  **Action (A):** Like a **Verb**. Refers to a process, change, action, or "doing".
    *   Examples: `wai` (to flow), `ta` (to act/change), `toki` (to speak), `tape` (to eat), `pene` (to improve/harmonize).

3.  **Descriptor (D):** Like an **Adjective** or **Adverb**. Describes a quality, characteristic, or manner.
    *   Examples: `pene` (good/beautiful), `li` (small/short), `mo` (big/intense), `lon` (long/lasting), `sun` (clear/bright).

4.  **Marker (M):** Like a **Particle** or **Grammar Word**. These words have a specific grammatical job â€“ connecting ideas, marking possession, indicating questions, etc. They often have less conceptual meaning on their own.
    *   Examples: `o` (is/are), `ku` (question marker '?'), `ro` (of/'s), `ne` (on/at), `an` (and/we), `le` (Concept marker), `ta` (Action marker), `so` (Descriptor marker).

**Important:** Not every word can do every job! Some words are primarily Markers (`o`, `ku`), while others might only be Concepts (`ouman`). Many core words, however, are flexible across C, A, and D. The dictionary usually lists the potential roles for each word.

## How Do We Know the Role? Context!

If one word can be C, A, or D, how do we know which job it's doing *right now*?

Usually, **context** and **sentence position** tell you! We'll learn more about sentence structures later, but here's a sneak peek:

*   `Wai o pene.`
    *   `Wai` comes first, likely the main **Concept** (Water).
    *   `pene` comes after `o` (is), likely a **Descriptor** (good).
    *   Meaning: "Water is good."

*   `A wai heim.`
    *   `A` (I) is the starting **Concept**.
    *   `wai` comes next, likely the **Action** (to flow/go).
    *   `heim` (home) is the destination **Concept**.
    *   Meaning: "I flow/go home."

*   `Wai wai o pene!`
    *   Here `wai` is repeated (`wai wai`). Reduplication often intensifies. It could mean "Very watery" or "Constantly flowing".
    *   If it means "The flowing water..." then the first `wai` is a Descriptor and the second is a Concept.
    *   Meaning: "Flowing water is beautiful!" (Or perhaps "Constantly flowing is good!") - *See? Sometimes context is crucial!*

## Preview: Markers for Clarity

What if the sentence position isn't clear enough? Sunwai has special **Marker** words we can add *before* another word to lock in its role:

*   `le` + word -> Makes the word clearly a **Concept** (noun).
*   `ta` + word -> Makes the word clearly an **Action** (verb).
*   `so` + word -> Makes the word clearly a **Descriptor** (adj/adv).

Don't worry about *how* to use these perfectly yet! We'll cover them properly in Part 3. Just know they exist as tools for clarity when context isn't enough.

*   `le wai o pene.` = "**The water** is good." (`le` confirms `wai` is the Concept).
*   `A ta wai heim.` = "I **(action) go/flow** home." (`ta` confirms `wai` is the Action).
*   `Sipu so wai o u.` = "A **flowing/watery** system is chaotic." (`so` confirms `wai` is a Descriptor).

## Vocabulary Review

Think about the different roles these familiar words can play:

*   `wai` (Concept: water; Action: to flow; Descriptor: flowing/watery)
*   `sun` (Concept: clarity/knowledge/sun; Action: to clarify/understand; Descriptor: clear/bright/understood)
*   `pene` (Concept: goodness/beauty; Action: to improve/harmonize; Descriptor: good/beautiful)
*   `ere` (Concept: reflection/pair; Action: to reflect/pair; Descriptor: dual/reflective; Numeral: 2)
*   `li` (Concept: smallness; Action: to reduce; Descriptor: small/short; Numeral: 1)
*   `ta` (Concept: action/change; Action: to act/change; Descriptor: active/changing; Numeral: 3; *also Action Marker*)
*   `o` (Action: to be; *also Equative Marker*)
*   `le` (Concept: itself; *also Concept Marker*)

## Exercises

**1. Identify Potential Roles:** For each word, list the possible roles (C, A, D, M) it *could* have based on the descriptions above.
    *   `heim` (home, center; to center/target; central/homely) -> ______, ______, ______
    *   `o` (is/are marker; to be) -> ______, ______
    *   `li` (smallness; to reduce; small; numeral 1) -> ______, ______, ______, ______
    *   `ma` (earth/ground; to ground; earthen) -> ______, ______, ______
    *   `ku` (question marker; sense/inquiry; to sense/ask; sensory/inquiring) -> ______, ______, ______, ______

**2. Role Guessing (Context):** Based *only* on the sentence position, what is the *most likely* role (C, A, or D) of the **bold** word?
    *   `A **pene**.` -> ______ (I am good/beautiful)
    *   `**Pene** o mo.` -> ______ (Beauty/Goodness is big)
    *   `An ta **pene** le heim.` -> ______ (We improve the home)
    *   `Ma **wai**.` -> ______ (The earth flows/changes / The earth is watery) - *Could be A or D! Context needed.*
    *   `Le **sun** o pene.` -> ______ (The clarity/knowledge is good)
    *   `A **sun** e.` -> ______ (I understand you)

**3. Why Markers Help:** Look at the sentence `Ma wai.` above. Why might adding `le`, `ta`, or `so` before `wai` be helpful?
    *   `Le ma le wai.` = ________________________________________
    *   `Ma ta wai.` = ________________________________________
    *   `Ma so wai.` = ________________________________________

*Sun o wai!* (Clarity flows!) Understanding that words can play multiple roles is a huge step in learning Sunwai. It might seem tricky at first, but it allows for elegant and efficient communication once you get the hang of it. Trusting context is key, and the markers are there when you need extra precision.

This wraps up Part 1! You've learned the sounds, syllables, basic word stress, and the flexible nature of words. In Part 2, we'll start building more complete sentences and explore different structures. --> [Lesson 2.1 Establishing States with `o` (Before Actions)](Lesson%202.1%20Establishing%20States%20with%20`o`%20(Before%20Actions))
