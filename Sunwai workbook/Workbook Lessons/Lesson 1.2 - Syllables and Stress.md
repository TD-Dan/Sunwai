# **Lesson 1.2: Syllables and Stress (Building Blocks)**

## In this lesson:

*   **Learn the Sunwai syllable recipe:** How letters combine into sound chunks.
*   **See examples of allowed (and disallowed!) syllables.**
*   **Understand the basic rhythm:** Where the stress usually falls in a word.
*   **Practice breaking down words with Neko.**

## Lets go!

*Hai!* It's Neko again! In the last lesson, we learned the 15 letters - the ingredients of Sunwai (`A E I O U T N S K M W L H R P`). Now, let's see how we combine them into **syllables** (`kipuan` - symbols together), the small chunks of sound that make up words. Sunwai has a simple recipe for this.

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

*   Describe the Sunwai syllable structure (CVVC template).
*   Identify which consonants can start or end a syllable.
*   Recognize valid and invalid Sunwai syllables.
*   Break simple Sunwai words into their component syllables.
*   Identify the typically stressed syllable in a Sunwai word.

## The Sunwai Syllable Recipe (Sipu kipuan)

Every language has rules about how sounds can combine to form syllables and words. These rules might feel natural in your native language, but they can differ significantly between languages! Sunwai has its own specific, consistent set of rules designed for clarity and ease of learning across different language backgrounds.

**Why learn these rules?** Understanding Sunwai's syllable 'recipe' is key because:
*   It defines what sounds are possible and how they fit together.
*   It helps you pronounce words correctly and recognize word boundaries.
*   It prevents you from accidentally using sound combinations that aren't part of Sunwai (like certain consonant clusters or ending sounds common in English but not allowed here).

So, let's look at the simple template Sunwai uses for all its syllables:

**(C1) V1 (V2) (C2)**

Let's break down the recipe:

1.  **(C1)** - *Optional* **Starting Consonant:** Can be *any* of the 10 consonants (`t, n, s, k, m, w, l, h, r, p`).
2.  **V1** - **Required Vowel:** *Must* have one of the 5 vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`). This is the core sound!
3.  **(V2)** - *Optional* **Second Vowel:** Can have *another* vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`), but it *must be different* from V1 (so `ae` is okay, but `aa` is not). Double vowels like `aa` are used for stress, not basic syllables.
4.  **(C2)** - *Optional* **Ending Consonant:** Can end with *only these consonants*: `t, n, s, m, r, p`.
    *   **Cannot end in:** `k, w, l, h`. These sounds don't end syllables smoothly in Sunwai.

**Putting it Together:**

This recipe allows for different syllable shapes:

*   **V:** `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` (Just the required vowel)
*   **CV:** `ta`, `ne`, `ko`, `li`, `ma` (Consonant + Vowel)
*   **VC:** `an`, `es`, `ir`, `om`, `un` (Vowel + Allowed Ending Consonant)
*   **CVV:** `wai`, `hai`, `pei` (Consonant + Vowel + Different Vowel)
*   **VVC:** `oum`, `eis`, `aon` (Vowel + Different Vowel + Allowed Ending Consonant)
*   **CVC:** `sun`, `kas`, `lon` (Consonant + Vowel + Allowed Ending Consonant)
*   **CVVC:** `heim`, `pait` (Consonant + Vowel + Different Vowel + Allowed Ending Consonant)

**What's *NOT* Allowed:**

*   **Consonant Clusters:** No starting with `tr`, `sp`, `kl`, etc. No ending with `nt`, `sk`, `lp`, etc. (Only one consonant at the start, one at the end, if any).
*   **Invalid Endings:** Cannot end in `k, w, l, h`. (So `tok`, `maw`, `pil`, `mah` are invalid syllables).
*   **Same Vowel Doubled:** `aa`, `ee`, `ii`, `oo`, `uu` are not standard syllables (they are used for stress).
*   **No Vowel:** Every syllable *must* have at least one vowel. `ts`, `nk`, `m` are not valid syllables.

## Word Stress (Lisuwailu)

How do you know which part of a Sunwai word to emphasize?

*   **Rule of Thumb:** Stress usually falls on the **first syllable** of the word.
*   **How to Stress:** Often, you make the first vowel sound a bit longer.
    *   `Neko` -> sounds more like `Nee-ko` (`/ˈneː.ko/`)
    *   `pene` (good/beautiful) -> sounds more like `pee-ne` (`/ˈpeː.ne/`)
    *   `ouman` (person) -> sounds more like `oo-man` (`/ˈou.man/`)
*   **Exception:** If the first syllable already has two vowels (like `wai`, `hai`, `heim`), you usually don't lengthen it further. It's naturally a bit longer.
    *   `heim` -> just `heim` (`/heim/`) - already contains CVVC.
    *   `Hai` -> just `Hai` (`/hɑi/`) - already contains CVV.

*   **Artistic Freedom:** Remember, this is the *standard* way. Speakers can change stress for poetry, music, or emphasis! But learn the standard first.

## Vocabulary Introduced

Let's practice with these words:

*   `wai` `/wɑi/` - water, flow, change
*   `pene` `/ˈpeː.ne/` - good, beautiful, harmony
*   `heim` `/heim/` - home, center, target
*   `ouman` `/ˈou.man/` - person, sentient being
*   `li` `/li/` - small, short; one (1)
*   `ma` `/ma/` - earth, ground, foundation
*   `kas` `/kas/` - separate, different; but
*   `un` `/un/` - under, low, deep
*   `lon` `/lon/` - long, duration
*   (Review: `Sunwai`, `toki`, `sun`, `a`, `e`, `o`, `Neko`, `Hai`)

## Examples of Words and Syllables

*   `wai` -> CVV (one syllable)
*   `pene` -> CV . CV (`pe.ne` - two syllables)
*   `heim` -> CVVC (one syllable)
*   `ouman` -> VVC . VC (`ou.man` - two syllables)
*   `li` -> CV (one syllable)
*   `ma` -> CV (one syllable)
*   `kas` -> CVC (one syllable)
*   `un` -> VC (one syllable)
*   `lon` -> CVC (one syllable)
*   `toki` -> CV . CV (`to.ki` - two syllables)
*   `Neko` -> CV . CV (`Ne.ko` - two syllables)
*   `Sunwai` -> CVC . CVV (`Sun.wai` - two syllables)

## Exercises

**1. Syllable Shape ID:** Identify the structure (V, CV, VC, CVV, CVC, VVC, CVVC) of these single syllables:
    *   `o` -> ______ (V)
    *   `mu` -> ______ (CV)
    *   `an` -> ______ (VC)
    *   `hai` -> ______ (CVV)
    *   `kas` -> ______ (CVC)
    *   `eis` -> ______ (VVC)
    *   `ta` -> ______ (CV)

**2. Syllable Splitting:** Break these words into their syllables. (Hint: Look for the vowels!) These might be a bit hard to get "right" as there might be multiple possibilities and recognising existing syllables (we call these roots in Sunwai!) comes easier as you progress in your vocabulary.
    *   `pene` -> ______ . ______ (pe . ne)
    *   `toki` -> ______ . ______ (to . ki)
    *   `ouman` -> ______ . ______ (ou . man)
    *   `Sunwai` -> ______ . ______ (Sun . wai)
    *   `lutaum` (freedom) -> ______ . ______ (lu . taum) *or* (lut . aum) - *context often needed for multi-syllable non-compounds*
    *   `kulo` (color) -> ______ . ______ (ku . lo)

**3. Valid or Invalid?** Is each item a valid Sunwai syllable according to the rules? (Yes/No)
    *   `tik` -> ______ (Invalid: ends in k)
    *   `ne` -> ______ (Valid)
    *   `sta` -> ______ (Invalid: consonant cluster 'st')
    *   `lon` -> ______ (Valid)
    *   `eee` -> ______ (Invalid: double vowel)
    *   `mah` -> ______ (Invalid: ends in h)
    *   `au` -> ______ (Valid)
    *   `ka` -> ______ (Valid)

**4. Stress Practice:** Read these words aloud, trying to put stress (slightly longer vowel) on the first syllable.
    *   `pene` (pee-ne)
    *   `toki` (too-ki)
    *   `kulo` (kuu-lo)
    *   `ouman` (oo-man)
    *   `Neko` (Nee-ko)

*Pene!* You now understand how Sunwai sounds are put together into syllables and words, and how the basic rhythm works. This structure makes words distinct and relatively easy to pronounce.

In the next lesson, we'll explore a core idea: how a single Sunwai word can often wear different hats – acting as a noun, verb, or descriptor depending on how it's used! --> [[Lesson 1.3 - Words Wear Different Hats]]]]
