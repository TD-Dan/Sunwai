**3. Fill-in-the-Blanks:**
    *   `KE o lono.` (The past is memory.)
    *   `Le nuko uramako o li.` (The baby rabbit is small. - Note: *If focusing on the stage concept represented by the visual, NU could also fit conceptually depending on sentence context, e.g., "The next stage is brief."* But "Nuko uramako" is the most direct completion referencing the visual subject.)
    *   `NU o u.` (The future is uncertain.)
    *   `Le AMA o pene.` (The beginning is good.)

    *   `Mau o u.` -> The end is uncertain / chaotic.
