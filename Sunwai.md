[[Penetoki]] is a constructed language that aims to serve as an unifying common language for humanity. It uses sounds common to all human languages and incorporates the most beautiful and common words all around the world. The base set of words consists of 100 short words that can be used for rudimentary communication. An extended set of 1000 compound words are created by combining words from the base set to cover all everyday communication. A set of rules to extend the word pool are provided to allow for more exact and precise communication when needed. 

## Base principles
### Easy to learn, hard to master
Vowels and consonants used are the most common and easy to produce across all languages. Learning the base set of 100 words gives you skills to speak with any [[Penetoki]] speaker in any general topic. This could also be 'Easy to learn, hard to master' as the extensions and freedom give limitless options for exploration.
### Artistic freedom
Pronunciation, word order, syllable stressing and typography are all flexible and can be understood even if you use your native style. This supports suitability for poetic, musical and other artistic purposes. Artistic freedom also makes sure it can be hard to master as the ways of expression are limitless.
* Multiple homophones (Words have many layered meanings) allow for wordplay and nuanced meanings.
* Word order does not matter, except for particles that describe unidirectional relations.
	-> [[#Special set Typography]] defines the base for artistic letterforms that can be used with [[Penetoki]]
### Inclusion and neutrality is default
Inclusivity is created by broadening terms, not creating division or exclusivity. There is no distinction between male/female/other, human/animal/other or good/bad in the words themselves. However, language by its nature is a system of categorization; all of these these distinctions can be made if necessary for any specific use case. [[Penetoki]] is not a human centerric language at its roots but extends and specialices to be one.
	-> [[#Generality over specifity]]
### Extendability rules
The language can be extended beyond the base and extended set by following common rules laid out in the extended set. This makes it possible to incorporate specialist fields, such as software, engineering and medicine, into the language without losing the needed precision of words in such use cases.
	-> [[#Special set Mathematics]]
	-> [[#Special set Business and economy]]
	-> [[#Special set Civil engineering and architecture]]
### Worldwide heritage
Takes words and concepts from accross all languages. A celebration of human roots and varied cultures.

While the basic words and concepts are universal and broad in their meaning can they still reflect on human origins: the word [[#heim]] refers to any space dedicated to an individual or group of beings (house, apartment, cave, spaceship...) it still takes its roots from human experience and history.
### Language is wisdom solidified
Words contain meaning and meaning carries values. What words convey and carry inside them is not a trivial thing. Therefore language must hold beauty in its essence.

Examples:
	* **Ouman** = "Sentient being" - Word for human, ai, extraterrestial etc. is neutral in its content. 
	* **Li** = "Small" - does not have the meanings of powerless or insignificant - No hidden values or connotations in words.

**Toki o sun!** = "Language is wisdom!"
### Tought shapes world. Tought is language. Therefore language shapes world!
It is not triial how we speak and think. The ideas contained in words affect the way we think and act. Therefore it is critical that we use a language that contains the right

**Sun wai oum. Sun o toki. Sunta toki wai wai oum!** = "Tought shapes world. Tought is language. Therefore language shapes world!"

The constructs and ideas contained in a language are vital for the development and betterment of humankind.

## Similarities and roots with Toki Pona
[[Penetoki]] builds heavily on the principles of Toki Pona by Sonja Lang.
- Easy to learn and speak
- Simple and consice base vocabulary that is very broad in its meaning.

However, [[Penetoki]] adds improvements:
- where toki pona is more of an abstract language and a philosophy, [[Penetoki]] aims also for everyday usability and practicality.
- Allows wide artistic and expressive freedom with pronunciation, syllables, word ordering and letterforms, making it suitable for poetic, technical and everyday use.
- Advanced rules to create more specific words for more accurate communication
	- broad to narrow words by using compound words: ne + ko = nine + animal = nineanimal = cat
- Similar but more excact word overloading: one word can have multiple meanings depending on context, f.ex 'li' can indicate 'small, short' or number 'one' depending on context and sentences structure. It can also be used as a verb to mean 'to reduce, to shorten'. Overloading can always resolved with particles if necessary for clarity.

## Creator and history of [[Penetoki]]
The language was created and conceptualized over several years by Daniel Herkert as a hobby project to both create an unifying language for humanity and to improve upon the foundations laid by toki pona. Several AI language models were used as assistants to gather knowledge and statistics of humanitys languages.

# Letters

> Penetoki alphabets is order: **A E I O U T N S K M W L H R P**

[[Penetoki]] uses most used and easy to learn vowels and consonants, almost similar to Toki Pona.
Letter distribution across words follows Zipf distribution for natural feel in vowel and consonant frequencies. These are listed as 'target frequency' in the following tables.

The 15 used letters are ordered for easy remembering with phonetic sounds and creates the penetoki alphabetic order:

**[[A]] [[E]] [[I]] [[O]] [[U]]**				(the vowels, from common to rare)
**[[TA]] [[NE]] [[SI]] [[KO]] [[MU]]**		(the common consonants)
**[[WAI]] [[LE]] [[HI]] [[RO]] [[PU]]**		(the rare consonants)

This can be sang with a melody to learn the alphabet.
For the consonants these are the names of the letters and do not restrict them from being combined with other vowels.

Pronunciation of the letter can:
- use standard IPA for clarity
* Softer or harder pronunciation can be selected instead of the standard to match the context and artistic expression
* Speaker's native pronunciation can be used for learners of the language OR as an 'i'm proud of my heritage' type of statement.

(( Current vowel distribution suggest that future word additions should prefer adding words with a and i, and avoid using e, and o and boost the usage of u in sentence level. ))

# Syllables

### Syllable structure

Syllables follow form CVVC:
	*C1* **V1** *V2* *C2*

Where:
	*C1*	*optional consonant*
		- allowed: t, n, s, k, m, w, l, h, r, p
	**V1** 	**vowel, always required**
		- allowed: a, e, i ,o ,u
	*V2* 	*optional extra vowel a, e, i, o, u (rare)*
		- allowed: a, e, i ,o ,u
		-must differ from V1 (e.g. ae is allowed, ee is forbidden) 
	*C2* 	*optional consonant*
		- allowed: t, n, s, m, r, p
		- not allowed: k, h, w, l, h (these create awkward and hard to voice syllables)

#### Examples of allowed syllables
1. **Minimal structure**:
    - `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` (only vowels).
    - `ta`, `ne`, `si`, `ko`, `pu` (C1 + V1).
    - `an`, `es`, `ir`, `om`, `up` (V1 + C2).
2. **With two vowels**:
    - `ae`, `io`, `ua`, `ei`, `ou` (V1 + V2).
    - `kai`, `mou`, `wei`, `sio`, `hue` (C1 + V1 + V2).
3. **Full structure**:
    - `tan`, `kes`, `mir`, `por`, `sul` (C1 + V1 + C2).
    - `kair`, `maus`, `pein`, `wous`, `lier` (C1 + V1 + V2 + C2).
#### Examples of not allowed syllables
1. **Double vowels**:
    - `aa`, `ee`, `ii`, `oo`, `uu`.
2. **Invalid final consonants**:
    - `tak` (ends with `k`), `mah` (ends with `h`), `law` (ends with `w`), `pal` (ends with `l`).
3. **Consonant clusters**:
    - `tra` (two consonants at start), `ans` (two consonants at end).
4. **Missing vowels**:
    - `tk`, `nm`, `ss` (no vowels).
5. **Disallowed vowels or consonants not part of penetoki letters**:
    - `ga` (invalid C1 `g`), `yom` (invalid C1 `y`), `fir` (invalid C1 `f`)

> Long syllable form allows for varied root words that are both easy to distinguish and define the character of the language.

> Souble vowel (aa,ii..) is reserved for word stress, see section [[#Stylistic recommendations for clear communication]] below
### Stylistic recommendations for clear communication

**1. Stress on first syllable**
> First consonant on the word can be stressed
> Maheim -> <u>m</u>-a-a-h-e-i-m	**/ˈmɑː.he.ɪm/**

> First vowel can be longer to make word recognition easier:
> Neko -> <u>n</u>-e-e-k-o **/ˈneː.ko/**

> If the first syllable has a double vowel, no lengthening is done
> Hai -> <u>h</u>-a-i **/ˈhai/**
# Words

## Words: Structure, Meaning, and Creation

Penetoki words are designed to be meaningful, flexible, and systematically related. Understanding their structure and inherent multi-layered meaning is key to both using and extending the language effectively.

### 1. Homophonity: The Multi-Layered Nature of Words

A core design principle of Penetoki is **homophonity**: most words intentionally possess multiple layers of meaning and can function flexibly in different grammatical roles based on context or the use of clarifying particles. This avoids needing unique words for every nuance and allows for expressive depth with a concise vocabulary.

Each word entry in the dictionary typically lists its potential roles:

1.  **Marker (M):** Grammatical function (particles, pronouns, conjunctions like `o`, `an`, `le`, `ta`, `si`, `se`). Defines syntax.
2.  **Concept (C):** Noun-like function (things, ideas, beings like `wai`, `sun`, `ouman`). Ontological particular.
3.  **Action (A):** Verb-like function (processes, changes, doings like `tape` [to eat], `wai` [to flow], `pene` [to improve]). How the concept interacts.
4.  **Descriptor (D):** Adjective/Adverb-like function (qualities, descriptions like `pene` [good/beautiful], `li` [small], `mo` [big]). Ontological universal.

This layering allows for rich wordplay and requires attention to context for interpretation, but also provides inherent efficiency.

### 2. Word Structure: Roots and Compounds

Penetoki vocabulary is built from two main types of words:

*   **Root Words:** These are the foundational, often single-syllable building blocks of the language (e.g., `a`, `ta`, `wai`, `sun`, `heim`). They represent the most basic concepts. (They are sometimes categorized as Prime, Secondary, and Tertiary roots based on their phonetic simplicity and foundational role).
*   **Compound Words:** The vast majority of Penetoki words are formed by combining two or more roots, or existing compounds. This is the **primary and strongly preferred method of vocabulary expansion**, creating a logical and interconnected lexicon.

### 3. Principles for Creating New Words

While the official Base and Extended sets cover much communication, creating new words may be necessary for specific fields or expression. This should always prioritize internal consistency and the language's philosophy.

**Compounding: The Core Method**
Forming new words primarily involves combining existing Penetoki words:

1.  **Identify Core Concepts:** Break down the new idea into essential parts representable by existing words.
2.  **Combine Logically:** Join the words, often reflecting modifier-head or conceptual flow (e.g., `pene` [good] + `toki` [language] → `penetoki`).

**Hierarchy for Word Creation:**
Follow this preferred order when developing a new term:

1.  **Compound Internally First:** Always try to build the word from existing Penetoki roots/compounds that logically convey the meaning. This maintains system integrity (e.g., `oum` + `an` → `ouman`).
2.  **Seek Resonant Compounds:** *If* a meaningful internal compound *also happens* to phonetically suggest a relevant external word *without sacrificing internal logic*, this is ideal. It adds familiarity while respecting the system.
    *   *Example:* **`neko`** (cat) is internally `ne` (nine) + `ko` (lifeform). Its resemblance to Japanese *neko* is a bonus resonance, fitting the "Worldwide Heritage" spirit subtly.
3.  **Prioritize Conceptual Fitness:** Ensure the new word fits naturally within Penetoki's semantic map. Is it aligned with its root meanings? Is it overly specific where a general term or phrase would do?
4.  **Limited Loans (Use Sparingly):** Direct borrowing is a last resort, acceptable *only* for:
    *   Highly specific, culturally bound concepts (unique foods, rituals) difficult to compound clearly.
    *   Technical/scientific terms challenging to represent concisely via compounding.
    *   **Crucially:** Any loan *must* be adapted to Penetoki phonetics and syllable structure and be clearly marked as such. Excessive loans damage the language's systemic nature.

**Essential Rules and Constraints for All New Words:**
*   **Phonetics & Syllables:** Use only the 15 official letters and adhere strictly to the `(C1)V1(V2)(C2)` syllable structure (respecting allowed final consonants `t, n, s, m, r, p`).
*   **Compounding Mechanics:**
    *   Apply simplification rules: e.g., vowel and consonant doubling is removed (`sun + ne -> sune`), (`ta + an -> tan`)
    *   Avoid syllable repetition unless specifically creating an emphasis word (`li li` -> tiny) or an established concept derived from repetition (`sisi` -> number concept).
*   **Word Length:** Aim for conciseness. While not a hard rule, words over 3-4 syllables warrant scrutiny – could a phrase or simpler term work?

**Guiding Philosophy:**
New words should ideally reflect Penetoki's ethos: clarity, elegance, a blend of simplicity and depth, and the goal of "Language is wisdom solidified."

### 4. Generality Over Specificity

A practical application of Penetoki's philosophy is preferring simple, general terms when context is clear. Compounding allows for specificity *when necessary*, rather than defaulting to narrow terms.

*   **Example:** Use **`ouman`** (sentient being) for general reference. Only use more specific compounds like `ouman`**`koma`** (human of Earth), `ouman`**`uma`** (extraterrestrial), or `ouman`**`pi`** (AI) when the distinction is crucial to the meaning. This maintains neutrality and inclusivity by default.

Proverb:: *Oumankoma, oumanuma an oumanpi o oum ouman!* = "Humans, aliens and ai are all sentient beings"
### 5. Fitting the new word into correct word set

Newly created words, following these principles, typically expand the **Extended Set** (cross-domain useful words) or contribute to **Special Sets** (domain-specific vocabulary like mathematics, engineering, etc.), all building upon the foundational **Base Set**.

# Word sets
Words are divided into base set, extended set and many special sets. **Base set** consists roughly 100 most used words and should suffice for casual everyday use. **Extended set** of 300-1000  words add depth and presiness to the language. In addition **Special set**s for mathematics, engineering, medicine etc. can be added.

> -> Refer to the [[Penetoki full dictionary.baked]] for full list and descriptions of the words.

## Base set
Base set covers all day to day encounters and broad concepts. . Knowing these words gives you ability to fully interact with society. It can also be tought as a 'travel set'. These words used in sentences rely heavily on context to be understood as they are quite broad in their meaning and can have multiple meanings and uses.

In total the base set has roughly 100 Words.


Base set is further divided into [[#Roots]] and [[#Base compounds]].


> The full mapping of base set meanings over semantic spatial dimensions can be found in [[#Appendix 1: Dimensionality of base set]].

### Roots
#### Prime roots (5 words)
- The 5 vowel letters ( A E I O U) make a micro language by themselves.
- They define the tonality of [[Penetoki]].
- Each prime root together with others map multiple dimensions of meaning. For example a in the context of interaction resolves to I/me, observer, locust of attention. In the context of physicality it represents solidity. This embodies the concept that on the surface words are easy to learn and seem simple (I/me), but actually convey a deeper meaning and truth about the universe.
#### Secondary Roots (10 words)
- Are made of single syllables and are the two groups: common TA NE SI KO MU and rare WAI LEI SI RO PU.
- These complement and expand the dimensions of prime roots.

#### Tertiary Roots ( ~35 words)
* More varied syllables in the form CVV, CVC, CVVC and VVC
- Together with prime, secondary and tertiary roots define the vocal repertoire of [[Penetoki]]. No other syllables can be used in [[Penetoki]] than the roots.
- Examples: Heim, Oum, Hat, Hai

### Base compounds

Rest of the base set is made of compounds. 
* Usually made up from two root words, but can use three or more if suitable.
* Can also use other compound words as one of the roots.
* Can introduce new syllables if needed

## Extended set
Extended set of roughly 1000 words is created by combining [[#Base set]] words into compound words. This set brings clarity and exactness to communication and removes ambiquity in communication.

Words in extended set are cross domain words that are generally useful in any field.

As the extended set is constructed from the base words it aims to be mostly self teaching. Meaning of extended words could be learned just from reading or interaction with [[Penetoki]] speakers. Every extended word includes some kind of insight or 'knack' to make remembering it easy. For example the word for **maheim** is a compound word made from **ma** + **heim**, 'land' + 'home'.


## Special sets
Numerous special sets extend [[Penetoki]] into specific domains. They provide words and constructs to exactly communicate the nuances and finer details in those fields. Size of special sets is not limited, but their word lists should reflect the principles of [[Penetoki]]: Most used words should appear first in the dictionary and be the shortest and easiest to remember. It is recommended to further split the sets into subsets.

Special sets can:
- extend usage of existing words.
- introduce new roots and compound words
- loan words directly from established practises, words must be "penetokisized": letter, syllable and word rules have to be adhered to.

Special sets so far:

-> [[#Special set Linguistics]]
->[[#Special set Mathematics]]
->[[#Special set Business and economy]]

# Sentences, grammar

## Default Sentence Flow

When Markers aren't used to clarify roles, sentence meaning typically builds from left to right following these common patterns:


	C

* States or names a single **Concept**.

Example:: *Wai.* = "Water." / "There is water."

   
	C - A

* A **Concept** performs an **Action**.

Example:: *Neko wai.* = "Cat flows / moves fluidly." (wai acts as Action)


	C - A - C

* The first **Concept** performs an **Action** affecting the second **Concept**.

Example:: *Neko tape waku.* = "Cat eats duck." (neko acts on waku via tape)


	C - A - C - D

* Like C-A-C, but the final **Descriptor** describes the second **Concept** (the target/receiver).

Example:: *Neko tape waku li.* = "Cat eats a small duck." (li describes waku)


>  Remember: This is the default flow. Word order is flexible, and using Markers (o, le, ta, so, se, etc.) allows for many other structures and clarifies meaning.

## Basic sentence structures

### 1. Equative (X is Y)

`[X] o [Descriptor]`

Use the particle **o** ("is") to link a descriptor.

*Neko o li* = "Cat is small."

*A o heim.* = "I am target/home" = "I feel like im at home." (poetic)

- **Flexible Order:**
    - *Neko o pene.* = "The cat is beautiful."
    - *Pene o neko!* = "Beautiful is the cat!" = "Beauty is cat" (poetic; implies the essence of beautiness is expressed in cats) 

- **Negation:** Add **no** before **o**.
    - *Neko no o inuko.* = "The cat is not a dog."

### 2. Excaggaration (X is more intense)

	'[x] [x]'

Any word repeated intiensifies its meaning.

* *Li li* = "Tiny" ("small small")
* *Mo mo* = "Huge" ("big big")
* *o o* = "Really is"

* *A o o tape!* = "I am really hungry!"
* *E si si ku?* = "Did you measure it exactly?"

> Reduplication is used in myriad languages; **Hawaiian, Yoruba, Swahili, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Māori, etc.** and is a common pattern.
### 3. Possessive (X has Y, Y is X's)

`[Owner] hat [Possessed]`  X has Y
`[Owned] ro [Owner]`  Y is X's

The particle **hat** marks possession.

- **Literal Ownership:**
    - *A hat heim.* = "I have a home."

- **Possessive Phrase:**
    - *A heim hat pene.* = "My home is beautiful." = "My home has beauty." = "Me home have beautifull"

- **Negation**
    - *A no hat heim.*  = "I dont have a home"

The particle **ro** marks ownership.
* **Literal Ownership:**
	* *Heim ro a.* = "My home"
	* *Tape ro neko* ="Cat's food"

- **Omit hat/or if clear:**
    - *A heim.* = "My home."

Further examples:
* *Tape ro neko hat lumako!* = "Cat's food has vegetables!"
### 4. Negation (not X)

	'no [X]'
The word *[[#no]]* can be inserted in front of anything to flip its meaning over.

*no neko* = "Not a cat" / "No cats here"
*A no i heim* = "Im not at home.", literal. "I not in home"
*E no u ku?* = "Are you not conserned?", literal. "You not chaotic?"

### 5. Existential/Locative (There is X / X is Y)

`[X] o` 
`o [X]` 
`[X] o [Y]` 
No specific verb needed for existence or location, always use **o**.

- **Existence:**
    - *Wai o.* = "There is water."
    - *O wai.* = "Be water" = "Be flexible"

- **Location:**
    - *Neko o heim.* = "The cat is at home."

- **Negation:**
    - *Wai no o heim.* = "There is no water at home."

* **Omit o if clear:**
	* **Wai no heim**
### 6. Action (X does Y)

`[Subject] [verb] [Target]`  
`[Subject] ta [verb] [Target]`  

*The verb between subject and target indicates directed action.*
*The particle [[#ta]] can be used as action marker to resolve ambiquity in a sentence, if necessary.*

- **Action:**
    - *A **ta** heim.* = "I aim."
    - *E **ta si** tama.* = "You measure the road"
    - *Neko **tape** waku. U neko!* = "The cat eats duck. Bad cat!"

- **Flexible:**
    - ***Ta** heim a!* = "Target me!"

### 7.Yes/No Questions

`[...] ku?`  

*Add **ke** at the end to form a question.*

- *E hat heim ku?* = "Do you have a home?"
- *Neko o pene ku?* = "Is the cat beautiful?"

- **Multiple Options:**
    - *E ta heim ??? bisu ku?* = "Are you going home **or** to the market?"
    - (( Needs a dedicated or particle for multiple options ))

### 8. Imperative (Command/Request)

`[verb] + [verb] + [Target]`  
Use repetition for emphasis

- **Direct Command:**
    - *Ta ta heim!* = "Go home!"

- **Polite Request:**
    - *Tape ta ku?* = "Could (you) bring food?"

- **Polite Command:**
    - *Tape ta ta ku?* = "Could (you) bring food?"

> Omit the subject if clear from context.

### 9. Benefactive (X does Y for Z)

`[Subject] ta [Action] ne [Recipient]`  
*Use **ne** ("on/for") to indicate the beneficiary.*
(( Not clear. maybe a different particle for 'for'))

- *A ta tape ne e.* = "I bring food **for** you."
    
- *Neko ta wai ne heim.* = "The cat carries water **to** the home."

### 10. Comparative (X is more Y than Z)

`[X] o [Quality] se [Z]`  
`[X] o [Quality] [Z] se`  

* *Neko o li inuko se.* = "Cat is smaller than dog."
* *Inuko o mo se neko.* = "Cat is smaller than dog."

### 11. Relative (X is more Y)

	`[X] o [Quality Y] se`  
*Add **se** after adjective to make it relative*

* *A o li se.* = "I am smaller."
* *Inuko o mo se* = "Dog is bigger."

With rule [[#2. Excaggaration (X is more intense)]]:
* *A o li se se.* = "I am much smaller."
	vs.* *A o li li se.* = "I am tinier."
* *Neko o li li inuko se se.* = "Cat is much tinier than dog."
### 12. Causative (X makes Y do Z)
(( needs particles and improvement ))
`[Causer] ? [Doer] ? [Action]`  


### 13. Conditional (If X, then Y)

Conditional sentences express that one situation or event (the result/apodosis) depends on another situation or event (the condition/protasis) being true or occurring. Penetoki uses the optional particle **`Usi`** to mark the condition and the optional particle **`se`** to mark the consequence.

*   **`Usi`** (`u`+`si`): Marks the conditional clause ("if"). Its use clarifies that the clause is hypothetical or a prerequisite.
*   **`se`**: Can optionally introduce the main/consequent clause ("then", "in that case"), improving clarity, especially in spoken language.
*   **`sunta`**: Can replace `se` when a strict logical consequence ("therefore") is intended.

**Common Structures:**

1.  **Contextual (Markers Omitted):**
    `[Condition Clause], [Result Clause].`
    *   Relies purely on juxtaposition and context. Common in simple or poetic usage.

Example:: *A hat tape, a pa ne e.* = "(If/When) I have food, I give [it] to you."

2.  **Explicit Condition (`Usi`):**
    `Usi [Condition Clause], [Result Clause].`
    *   Clearly marks the condition. The consequence is understood by context.

Example:: *`Usi` a hat tape, a pa ne e.* = "**If** I have food, I give [it] to you."

Example:: *`Usi` ma o eis, wai eis.* = "**If** the ground is cold, water freezes."

3.  **Explicit Condition and Consequence (`Usi`, `se`):**
    `Usi [Condition Clause], se [Result Clause].`
    *   Provides maximal clarity, marking both parts of the conditional structure.
Example:: *`Usi` a hat tape, `se` a pa ne e.* = "**If** I have food, **then** I give [it] to you."
Example:: *`Usi` e pai sun, `se` e toki pene.* = "**If** you think clearly, **then** you speak well."

4.  **Explicit Logical Consequence (`Usi`, `sunta`):**
    `Usi [Condition/Premise Clause], sunta [Result/Conclusion Clause].`
    *   Used when the relationship is one of logical deduction or strong causality.
Example:: *`Usi` oum ouman o sipu, `sunta` oum hat pai.* = "**If** all sentient beings are systems, **therefore** all possess mind/thought."
Example:: *`Usi` lumia seno, `sunta` ko no ta sun.* = "**If** there is no light, **therefore** life does not know/see." (Strict consequence)

5.	**Result and condition can also be reversed:**

Example:: *se pene, usi a tape.* = "Its good, if you eat."
### 14. Repetive (X repeats, always X, X times)

	[x] ti
	ti [x]
	[number] ti

* After a word:
	* *Neko tape ti* = "Cat eats **again**"

* Before a word:
	*A hat ti tape!* = "I am **always** hungry!"

* With a number:
	*  *E hat tape ta ti* = "You have eaten three **times**."
	* *Si e an ti.* = "Measure yourself two times."

## Markers
Penetoki uses markers to clarify usage of words. These are optional and allow for more precise communication when needed.

### Concept marker Le

	le [subject]
	le [concept] [action]

 Concept marker [[#Le]] can be used to clarify the usage of the next word:
 	*A **le waiko*** = I (as) **the fish**.
 		vs. A waiko = "I swim."
 	*A ta le tama ne wai* = "I take the bridge over the water" ("I action bridge(subject of action) over water")
 		vs. *A ta tama ne wai.* = "I bridge over water"

The next word defaults to be used as an action if not marked otherwise:

Example:: *Le neko **tabe*** = "The cat **eats**."

### Action marker Ta (verb marker)

	ta [action]

Action marker [[#Ta]] can be used to mark action in the following word:
	*A ta tape waiko.* = "I **eat** the fish."
		vs. *A tape waiko* = "I food fish" (Clear if sitting in the table where food is presented, but not so clear without context.)

### Descriptor marker So (adjective/adverb marker)

    so [descriptor]

Descriptor marker [[#So]] can be used to clarify that the next word is being used in its descriptive capacity (as an adjective modifying a noun or as an adverb modifying an action/verb). Its use is optional but helpful in ambiguous contexts.

*   **As Adjective:**
    *   Typically precedes the descriptor, which might precede or follow the noun it modifies, or act as a predicate linked by `o`.

Example::    *So mo neko tape.* = "**Big** cat eats." -  `so mo` modifies `neko`.

Example::    *Neko tape so mo.* = "Cat eats **big** food." - `so mo` modifies `tape`.

Example::    *Neko o so li.* = "The cat is **small**." - `so li` is the predicate descriptor.

*   **As Adverb:**
    *   Often follows the verb or action being described.

Example::    *A ta pai so pene.* = "I think **beautifully/well**." - `so pene` modifies `ta pai`.

Example::    *Neko ta tape so li.* = "The cat eats **subtly/a little bit**." - `so li` modifies `ta tape`.

### Numeral marker si

	si [word]

Numeral marker [[#Si]] can be use to clarify that the next word is a number
	*si li* = 1

> see [[#Numbers]] for more details

## Marker chaining
When words that are used as markers are used in their other meanings they must be clarified with preceding markers:

*le ta* = the action (as noun)
*ta le* = subjectification (the act of subjecting)

# Detailed Phonetics, writing and speaking guide

## Pronunciation and artistic stress
Pronunciation of the words is as free as is with syllables.
Standard aproaoch is to apply stress  to the first syllable, but this is not necessary. Stress can also be placed on other parts if it enhances the message or adds poetic strength.
	**Ne***ko o no o oumko* - *ne***ko** *no o* **oum***ko!*	- (This) cat<u>animal</u> is not <u>every</u>animal!. This cat does not resemble an animal!

## Simplicity over complexity
Favor simple words and grammar when the context is clear.

(context: subject is leaving a place)

Example:: *A wai heim.*	-	"I am going home", ("I transition home")

	vs.

Example:: *Le a ta wai i oumanheim.* = "I am going to home." ("I movement into building") - overly specific and accurate for the context

Example:: *si rero* = *si resenoseno* = 200
Example:: *si takilo-kuloro* = *si takulosenoseno* =3700
Example:: *si takulokilo* =37 000
Example:: *si paitameka-marokilo-nere* = 63 400 092

* **speaking about the numbers themselves:**

Example:: ***Le sisi ta** o pene* = "**The number three (concept)** is good."

## Ordinals
In [[Penetoki]], ordinals (first, second, third, etc.) are formed using the particles **[[#si]]** (numeral marker) and **[[#to]]** (sequence marker). These particles orbit numerals freely, allowing both technical precision and poetic ambiguity.

### Core Principles

1. **Flexible Syntax**:
    - **si** and **to** can flank numerals in any order.
    - Clarity is **optional**; speakers add particles only when needed.
2. **Minimalist Foundation**:
    - No rigid rules—context and intent resolve ambiguity.
    - Standalone numerals can imply ordinals (_a_ = "one" or "first").

### Formation & Examples

| Structure         | Meaning                      | Example Sentence              | Translation                         |     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --- |
| **si+numeral+to** | Standard ordinal (technical) | _A ta **si a to**._           | "I go **first**."                   | 1)  |
| **to+numeral+si** | Emphasizes sequence          | _Tilo **to heim si** o pene!_ | "The **fourth** time is beautiful!" |     |
| **numeral + to**  | Casual/poetic ordinal        | _Heim o **heim to**._         | "Home is **fourth**."               |     |
| **si + numeral**  | Hybrid cardinal/ordinal      | _An o **si an**._             | "We are measured **two**."          |     |
| **to + numeral**  | Abstract sequence            | _Sun o **to ta**._            | "Knowledge is ordered **third**."   |     |
|                   |                              |                               |                                     |     |
1) (( A more technical noun needed here to replace "I"))

> Note: **si + to + numeral** or **numeral + to + si** breaks *si* out of the numerals vicinity. Therefore si is here considered as their own concepts *si* **to numeral** and **numeral to** *si*.
	- *Si to ta.* = "Measuring third."
	- *Ta to si.* = "Third measured."

### Examples:
* 1. Basic Ordinals:
	- **si a to** = "first"
	    - _A ta **si a to**._ = "I go **first**."
	- **si e to** = "second"
	    - *Tilo **si e to** o pene!* = "The **second** time is beautiful!"
	- **si ma to** = "fourth"
	    - *Heim o **si ma to**.* = "Home is the **fourth**"

* 2. Dates and Time:
	- _Tilo **si ta to** ne ma._ = "The **third** day on Earth."
	- _Wai o **si ne to** tilo._ = "Water flows in the **ninth** hour."

#### 3. Rankings and Hierarchy:

- _E o **si lili to** ku?_ = "Are you **sixth** [in rank]?"
    
- _lumako o **si oum to** ne ko._ = "Plants hold the **tenth** priority for lifeforms."

#### 4. Poetic/Abstract Usage:

- _Oum to o seno._ = "The **final** moment is timeless."
    
- _To ro to, pi ro pi!_ = "Order begets order, cycles beget cycles!"
    

### Flexibility:

1. **Omission of _si_**:
    
    - _A ta **a to**!_ = "I go **first**!" (Casual, context-dependent)
        
    - _Heim o **heim to**._ = "Home is **fourth**." (Numerology context)
        
2. **Standalone _to_**:
    
    - _Sun o **to**._ = "Knowledge follows **order**."
        
    - _A **to** e **to**!_ = "Me **first**, you **next**!"
        


# Dictionary

For complete dictionary with entries see [[Penetoki full dictionary]].
## Dictionary style guide:

### 1. Entry Heading  
`# [WORD]`  
Use bold/latin form (e.g., `# A`). No IPA or translations here.
### 2. Metadata  
Use `::` notation for categories. Include:  
- **IPA**  
- **Marker** (if applicable)  
- **Concept**  
- **Action**  
- **Descriptor**  

Example:  
```markdown
IPA::			/ˈɑ/
Marker:: 		**I/Me**
Concept::		**Observer, self**
Action::		**To observe**
Descriptor::	**1, one**
```
### 3. Usage

- Split into subcategories: ### Marker, ### Concept, etc.
- Provide examples using the Example:: prefix.
- Each Example:: block must be preceded and followed by a single blank line for parsing.
- Italicize Penetoki sentences with asterisks and add translations in "quotes"

Example:  
```markdown
### Marker  
- First-person pronoun  

Example:: ***A** o ouman.* = "**I** am human."

```
### 4. Compounds  
- List compounds as bullet points with definitions and roots.  
- Use `[[#Compound]]` syntax for internal links.  

Example:  
```markdown
## Compounds  
- **[[Tama]]** = Road (*ta + ma* = "movement on earth")  
- **[[Neko]]** = Cat (*ne + ko* = "nine-lifeform")  
```
### 5. Origin  
- Use bullet points with language names in **bold**.  
- Include roots from penetoki if aplicable
- Include etymological roots and adaptations.  
- - Use _underscores_ to italicize non-Penetoki words or transliterations within the Origin section.

Example:  
```markdown
## Origin  
- **Penetoki**: **[[AN]]** + **[[TA]]** = "Togetherness action" - 'n' dropped for ease of speak
- **Arabic**: _أَنَا_ (_Ana_, I)  
- **Sanskrit**: _अहम्_ (_Aham_, self)  
```
### 6. Proverbs  
- Format as `Proverb:: [Penetoki sentence] = "[Translation]"`. 
- Each Proverb:: block must be preceded and followed by a single blank line for parsing.
- Add contextual notes if needed.  

Example:  
```markdown
## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ouman o i a.* = "Sentience is in me."

```
### 7. Notes & Formatting  
- **Examples**: Italicize Penetoki sentences with *asterisks*, add translations in "quotes". No need to use explicit markers when sentence structure (SVO word order) is clear.
- **Origin**: Italicize with _underscores_ to distinguish from penetoki words.
- **Homonyms**: Clarify context-specific meanings (e.g., *a* = "I" vs. "one").  
- **Cross-references**: Link related entries with `[[#Entry]]`.  
- **Author Comments**: Use `author-comment::` for unresolved notes.  
- **Markdown**: Dont use tables; use lists and headers for readability. Follow the style strictly as its used for data retrieval.
### Example Entry  
```markdown
### A  
IPA::			/ˈɑ/  
Marker::		**I/Me**  
Concept::		**Observer, self**  
Action::		**To observe**  
Descriptor::	**1, one**  

## Usage  
### Marker  
- First-person pronoun  
Example::	_**A** o ouman._ = "**I** am human."  

### Descriptor

# Appendix 1: Dimensionality of base set

(( This section is experimental and not complete. ))

These charts map the meaning accross the base set words among different semantic dimensions/axis. Words define points, regions or patterns in given dimensions. Penetoki overloads words to multiple dimensions.

These are not necessarily directly the meanings of the roots, but rather the domains that words compounding from them should recede in.

> This part can be omitted by learners of the language and is more of an internal tool to help map new meanings to roots and compounds. If the language is built as its envisioned, then they should shine trough the language as deeper insights.

## Typograhic letter variants

[[Penetoki]] letter variants build on long lasting tradition of beautifull calligraphy, lettering and logograms. They are selected for vertical symmetry and inclusivity taking inspiration from all around the world.

[[Penetoki]] letter variants are an additional aesthetic variation and they do not alter pronunciation or meaning. They are not required as the modern latin letter variants can be used.

As a stylistic choise they are a tool to distinquish [[Penetoki]] from other languages and convey a future oriented, forward looking attitude. Their design allows for huge artistic freedom in typography, as they can be distinquished from each other easily. This allows for the tradition of beautiful typography to evolve further combining the beauty accross all languages.
