# Appendix 1: Dimensionality of base set

author-comment:: This section is experimental and not complete.

These charts map the meaning accross the base set words among different semantic dimensions/axis. Words define points, regions or patterns in given dimensions. Sunwai overloads words to multiple dimensions.

These are not necessarily directly the meanings of the roots, but rather the domains that words compounding from them should recede in.

> This part can be omitted by learners of the language and is more of an internal tool to help map new meanings to roots and compounds. If the language is built as its envisioned, then they should shine trough the language as deeper insights.
