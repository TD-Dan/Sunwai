# KOWAI

IPA::				/ˈko.wɑi/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state of changing sex characteristics over time (Sequential Hermaphroditism) or having fluid sex characteristics.**
Action::		**To change biological sex characteristics over time.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biologically fluid or changing sex characteristics (Sex-Fluid).**

> A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state where an individual lifeform can change its primary sex characteristics or functions (e.g., from male to female or vice-versa) during its lifespan, or exhibits fluidity in these characteristics. Derived from lifeform/body (`KO`) + flow/change (`WAI`). This is a biological descriptor.

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)
*   Modifies a noun (`[[Ko]]`, `[[Ouman]]`, `[[Kopu]]`, specific species names) to indicate biologically fluid or changing sex characteristics. Often requires `so` marker for clarity when acting purely descriptively, though predicate use with `o` is common.

Example::   *Waiko mu o **kowai**.* = "Many fish are biologically **sex-fluid**."

Example::   *Le sipu ro ko se o **kowai**.* = "The biology of that lifeform is **sex-fluid**."

Example::   *Se o Kopu **so kowai**.* = "That is a **biologically fluid body form**."

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological phenomenon of sex fluidity or change. Often requires `le` marker.

Example::   *Le **kowai** o sun hi ne ko.* = "Biological **sex-fluidity** is interesting knowledge in lifeforms."

Example::   *An sun **kowai** ne waiko pi.* = "We understand **sex-fluidity** in some fish."

### Action
*   To undergo a biological change in sex characteristics. Requires `ta` marker.

Example::   *I tilon pi, ko se **ta kowai** ro Koi nu Kota.* = "In its life cycle, that lifeform **changes biologically** from female to male."

Example::   *Ko kan **ta kowai** ne tilon hi.* = "Lifeforms can **change biologically** at different times."

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **[[Koi]]** (`ko + i`): Descriptor for biological female characteristics (can be a stage for a `Kowai` being).
*   **[[Kota]]** (`ko + ta`): Descriptor for biological male characteristics (can be a stage for a `Kowai` being).
*   (Other biological descriptors: Kore, Koa)
*   **[[Kopu]]** (`ko + pu`): The physical body form (can change in a `Kowai` being).
*   **[[Koipai]]** (`ko + i + pai`): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[WAI]]** (Flow, Change, Liquid). Conceptually links this biological state to the idea of sex characteristics "flowing" or "changing" over time.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Lono ro kowai o: ko kan wai.* = "Sex-fluid biology teaches that the body can change."

Proverb:: *Ne ko kowai, koipai kan wai mo.* = "For a biologically sex-fluid lifeform, body image can change significantly."
