# KOPITA

IPA::				/ˈko.pi.tɑ/
Concept::		**Reproduction (Biological Act), Procreation, Mating, Pollination**
Action::		**To reproduce biologically, procreate, mate, pollinate**
Descriptor::	**Reproductive, Procreative (relating to the biological act)**

> **Extended Set.** Represents the biological action involving the creation or joining of gametes/seeds (*[[Kopi]]*) to produce new offspring. This term focuses on the biological *function* of reproduction across different lifeforms (e.g., mating, spawning, pollination) and is distinct from acts of physical intimacy (*[[Koan]]*).

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological process or act of reproduction itself.

Example::   *Le **Kopita** o pi ro ko.* = "The **biological reproduction** is the cycle of life."

Example::   *Mu ko hat tilo **Kopita**.* = "Many lifeforms have a **reproductive** season."

Example::   *Sun ro **Kopita** o mo.* = "The knowledge of **biological reproduction** is complex."

### Action
*   Engaging in the specific biological act that leads to reproduction. Requires *ta* marker for clarity as a verb.

Example::   *Neko re **ta Kopita**.* = "The two cats **mate**."

Example::   *Lumako **ta Kopita** ne ha an ko li.* = "Plants **reproduce** via air (pollination) and small lifeforms (insects)."

Example::   *Waiko **ta Kopita** ne wai mo.* = "Fish **spawn/reproduce** in the big water."

Example::   *Se o sipu ro ko **ta Kopita**.* = "That is the system by which the lifeform **reproduces**."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something specifically related to the biological act of reproduction. Often requires *so* marker.

Example::   *Se o ta **so Kopita**.* = "That is a **reproductive** action."

Example::   *An sun sipu **so Kopita** ro kohi.* = "We understand the **reproductive** system of the bird."

Example::   *Tilo se o **Kopita**.* = "That time is **reproductive** (e.g., a mating season)."

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **[[Kopi]]** (*ko + pi*): The egg, seed, spore, or gamete involved in *kopita*.
*   **[[Nuko]]** (*nu + ko*): The newborn/offspring resulting from successful *kopita*.
*   **[[Koan]]** (*ko + an*): Intimate Bodily Togetherness/Connection. *kopita* is about biological function, *koan* is about physical closeness/connection. They may co-occur but are distinct concepts.
    *   *Example Distinction:* *Usi ko re ta koan so napai, se kan ta kopita.* = "If two lifeforms are sexually intimate, they might reproduce."

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[Kopi]]** (Egg, Seed, Gamete) + **[[TA]]** (Action, Change, Process). Signifies "Egg/Seed Action," directly referencing the biological units and the action involved in reproduction.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Kopita o ta ro ko.* = "Reproduction is the action of life."

Proverb:: *Pi ro Kopita o pi ro oum ko.* = "The cycle of reproduction is the cycle of all life."

Proverb:: *Kopita o no koan, hi kan o ata.* = "Reproduction is not (the same as) intimacy, but they can meet/occur together."
