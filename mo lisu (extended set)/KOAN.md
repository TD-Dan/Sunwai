# KOAN

IPA::				/Ëˆko.an/
Concept::		**Intimate Bodily Togetherness/Connection; Physical Closeness (e.g., holding, cuddling, nuzzling, grooming)**
Action::		**To be physically close/connected/intimate; To cuddle, hold, nuzzle** (*ta Koan*)
Descriptor::	**Physically Intimate/Close/Connected**

> **Extended Set.** Represents a state or act of close, often affectionate, physical connection and togetherness between lifeforms (*KO* + *AN*). The meaning centers on general physical intimacy like holding, cuddling, nuzzling, grooming, or huddling for warmth. It does **not** inherently refer to sexual activity.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the state or concept of close physical connection.

Example::   *Le **Koan** ro mama an nuko o pene.* = "The **physical closeness/connection** between the parent and offspring is beautiful/good."

Example::   *Mu ko na **Koan** ne eistilo.* = "Many lifeforms need **bodily togetherness** (e.g., huddling) in the cold season."

Example::   *Le **Koan** i oumanan o mo.* = "The **physical closeness** within the partnership is significant."

### Action
*   Engaging in acts of physical closeness or intimacy. Requires *ta* marker for clarity as a verb.

Example::   *Neko re **ta Koan**.* = "The two cats **are physically close / cuddling**."

Example::   *An **ta Koan**.* = "We **are physically close / cuddle**." (Default reading is non-sexual closeness).

Example::   *Mamapi an nuko **ta Koan**.* = "The parent and offspring **cuddle / are physically close**."

### Descriptor
*   Describes a situation or relationship characterized by physical closeness/intimacy. Often requires *so* marker.

Example::   *An hat pai **so Koan**.* = "We have an **intimate (physically close)** relationship/thought."

Example::   *Se o timo **so Koan**.* = "That is a time of **physical closeness/intimacy**."

**Usage Note on Expressing Sexual Intimacy:**
*Koan* itself does not mean "sex". To specifically describe physical intimacy that *is* sexual in nature, one must use descriptive phrases involving *[[Napai]]* (Sexuality/Desire-Mind) or rely on strong contextual cues. The phrase ***ta Koan so Napai*** ("to be physically close/intimate in a sexual manner") explicitly denotes sexual intimacy involving connection. For the biological act of reproduction, use *[[Kopita]]*.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[AN]]** (Together, And, We). Conceptualizes intimacy as "Body Togetherness." Definition explicitly focuses on non-sexual physical closeness and connection.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Koan o heim ro ko.* = "Physical closeness is a home for the body." (Implies comfort, safety).

Proverb:: *I Koan pene, pai pene.* = "In good/harmonious physical connection, the mind/experience is good/harmonious."
