# KOPI

IPA::				/Ëˆko.pi/
Concept::		**Egg, Seed, Spore, Gamete; Biological Starting Unit**
Action::		**(Rarely used directly; see Usage)**

> **Extended Set.** Represents the self-contained biological unit from which a new lifeform cycle begins, such as an egg, seed, spore, or gamete. Derived from lifeform (*KO*) and circle/cycle (*PI*). Primarily functions as a noun.

## Usage

### Concept (Primary Use)
*   Refers to the biological starting unit itself. It is typically used as a noun (the subject or object of a sentence) or in combination with other words to express specific relationships.

Example::   *Le **Kopi** o li.* = "The **egg/seed** is small."

Example::   *Oum ko nu ro **Kopi**.* = "All life is new from an **egg/seed/spore**."

Example::   *A kelumia **Kopi** mu.* = "I see many **eggs/seeds**."

### Expressing Relationships with *Kopi*
*   **Production:** Use *pu Kopi* ("to make/form Kopi").
    *   Example:: *Kohu mama **pu Kopi** ne heim.* = "The mother bird **produces/lays eggs** in the nest."
    *   Example:: *Lumako **pu Kopi** pi tilo.* = "The plant **produces seeds** cyclically."
*   **Containing:** Use *hat Kopi* ("to have Kopi") or *pu hat Kopi* ("structure having Kopi").
    *   Example:: *Pu se **hat Kopi**.* = "That structure (e.g., seed pod, ovary) **contains seeds/eggs**."
*   **Developing From:** Use phrases like *nu ro Kopi* ("new from Kopi") or the specific compound *[[Kopiko]]*.
    *   Example:: *Nuko o ko **nu ro Kopi**.* = "The offspring is the lifeform **new from the egg/seed**."

### Action
*   Direct use as a verb (*ta Kopi*) is highly uncommon and potentially unclear. Actions related to *Kopi* (laying, producing, planting) are better expressed using verbs like *pu* (make/form) or context-specific verbs if developed (e.g., a verb for "plant seed").

### Descriptor
*   Using *Kopi* directly as an adjective (*so Kopi*) is generally avoided as it lacks specific meaning. To describe qualities *associated* with eggs/seeds (e.g., potential, roundness, newness), use other relevant roots like *[[Lu]]*, *[[Pi]]*, or *[[Nu]]*. To describe something *related to the function* of *Kopi*, compound nouns (*Kopiheim*, *Kopita*) or descriptive phrases are clearer.

## Related Concepts
*   **[[Kopita]]** (*Kopi + ta*): The biological act of reproduction involving *Kopi*.
*   **[[Nuko]]** (*nu + ko*): The newborn/offspring that develops from *Kopi*.
*   **[[Kopiko]]** (*Kopi + ko*): Embryo, Larva ("egg/seed lifeform").

## Compounds
*   **[[Kopiheim]]** (*Kopi + heim*): Nest, Seed bank, Incubator ("egg/seed home").
*   **[[Kopipene]]** (*Kopi + pene*): Viable/Fertile egg/seed ("good egg/seed").

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[PI]]** (Circle, Cycle, Enclosure). Conceptualizes the egg/seed as the "Lifeform-Cycle" starting point or the "Lifeform-Enclosure."

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *I Kopi li, ko mo o kan.* = "In a small egg/seed, a great lifeform is possible."

Proverb:: *Kopi o pi ro ko.* = "The egg/seed is the circle/cycle of life."
