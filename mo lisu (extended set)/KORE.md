# KORE

IPA::				/ˈko.ɾe/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state of having characteristics typically associated with both male and female sexes (Intersex).**
Action::		**(Rarely used) To function biologically with mixed or intermediate sex characteristics.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biological characteristics typically associated with both male (`[[Kota]]`) and female (`[[Koi]]`) sexes, or characteristics intermediate between them (Intersex).**

> **Extended Set.** A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state where an individual's sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, chromosomal pattern, or hormonal patterns do not fit the typical definitions of solely male (`[[Kota]]`) or female (`[[Koi]]`). Derived from lifeform/body (`KO`) + pair/duality/reflection (`RE`). This is a biological descriptor.

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)
*   Modifies a noun (`[[Ko]]`, `[[Ouman]]`, `[[Kopu]]`) to indicate the presence of intersex biological characteristics. Often requires `so` marker for clarity when acting purely descriptively, though predicate use with `o` is common.

Example::   *Le ouman se o **Kore**.* = "That person is biologically **intersex**."

Example::   *Sun **Kore** o sun ko hi.* = "Knowledge of **intersex biology** is knowledge of diverse life."

Example::   *Ko mu hat Kopu **Kore**.* = "Many lifeforms have **intersex body forms**."

Example::   *Le sipu **Kore** ro ko o mo.* = "The **intersex biological system** of the lifeform is complex."

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological category or state of being intersex. Often requires `le` marker.

Example::   *An toki ne **Kore**.* = "We talk about **intersex [biology]**."

Example::   *Le **Kore** o sun pene ne ko.* = "Understanding the **intersex state** is good knowledge within biology."

### Action
*   To biologically function or develop with intersex characteristics. Less common than descriptive use.

Example::   *I tilo pi, ko se kan **ta Kore**.* = "In its life cycle, that lifeform can **function with intersex characteristics**."

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **[[Koi]]** (`ko + i`): Descriptor for biological role associated with large gamete production.
*   **[[Kota]]** (`ko + ta`): Descriptor for biological role associated with small gamete production.
*   (Other biological descriptors: Koa, Kowai)
*   **[[Kopu]]** (`ko + pu`): The physical body form.
*   **[[Koipai]]** (`ko + i + pai`): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[RE]]** (Pair, Duality, Reflection). Conceptually links the intersex state to the presence of a "pair" or "duality" of characteristics typically assigned separately to `Koi` and `Kota`.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Pai ro a kan o hi kore ro a.* = "One's identity can be different from one's intersex biology."

Proverb:: *Sipu ke o no sun kore.* = "Traditional systems often don't understand/recognize intersex biology."

Proverb:: *Kore o sun oum; Oum ko o pene.* = "Intersex biology is part of the spectrum of knowledge; All life is good/valid."
