# KOTA

IPA::				/ˈko.tɑ/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state/role associated with producing the smaller gamete type (e.g., sperm, pollen).**
Action::		**(Rarely used) To function biologically in the manner associated with producing the smaller gamete type.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biological characteristics related to the production or role of the smaller gamete type (e.g., sperm, pollen).**

> **Extended Set.** A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state or characteristics associated with the production of the smaller, typically more mobile type of gamete (e.g., sperm in animals, pollen in plants) involved in sexual reproduction. Derived from lifeform/body (`KO`) + external principle/action (`TA`). This is a biological descriptor, distinct from gender identity or physical form (`[[Kopu]]`).

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)
*   Modifies a noun (`[[Ko]]`, `[[Ouman]]`, `[[Kopu]]`, specific species names) to indicate the biological role associated with small gamete production. Often requires `so` marker for clarity when acting purely descriptively, though predicate use with `o` is common.

Example::   *Se o inuko **Kota**.* = "That dog **has the biology associated with producing sperm**." / "That is a biologically **male** dog." (*Using common English equivalent*).

Example::   *A kelumia ouman **so Kota**.* = "I see a person **whose biology relates to sperm production**." / "I see a biologically **male** person."

Example::   *Le Kopu **Kota** hat Kopi hi.* = "The **biologically male body form** has different gametes." (Lit: ...has different eggs/seeds - maybe phrase differently: *hat sipu Kopi hi* - different gamete system). *Revision: Le Kopu Kota hat Kopi Kota.* "The biologically male body form has male gametes."

Example::   *Le sipu **Kota** o hi.* = "The **biologically male system** is different."

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological category or characteristics defined by small gamete production. Often requires `le` marker.

Example::   *Le **Kota** o sun mo ne ko mu.* = "The **biological state related to small gamete production** is important knowledge for many lifeforms."

Example::   *An toki ne Koi an **Kota**.* = "We talk about the **biological roles related to large gametes** and **small gametes**."

### Action
*   To biologically function or develop in the manner associated with producing small gametes. Less common than descriptive use.

Example::   *Le nuko se **ta Kota**.* = "That offspring **is developing the biology associated with small gamete production**."

Example::   *I tilo pi, ko se **ta Kota**.* = "In its life cycle, that lifeform **functions biologically as the small-gamete producer**." (E.g., during the male phase of a sequential hermaphrodite).

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **[[Koi]]** (`ko + i`): Descriptor for the biological role associated with producing the larger gamete type.
*   **[[Kopi]]** (`ko + pi`): The gamete (egg/seed/sperm/pollen) itself. `Kota` describes the *producer* of the smaller type.
*   (Other biological descriptors: Kore, Koa, Kowai)
*   **[[Kopu]]** (`ko + pu`): The physical body form.
*   **[[Koipai]]** (`ko + i + pai`): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[TA]]** (Action, Change, Process, External principle). Conceptually links this biological role to the typically smaller, more mobile, active, or externally delivered nature of the sperm/pollen gamete compared to the larger, more internal/contained ovum/egg gamete (`Koi`).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Kota o no oum ro ko.* = "The biological role [of small gamete producer] is not the entirety of the lifeform."

Proverb:: *Sun Kota o sun kopita.* = "Understanding the biology [of the small gamete producer] involves understanding reproduction."
