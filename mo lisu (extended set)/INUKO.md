# INUKO

IPA::				/ˈi.nu.ko/
Concept::		**Dog (domestic or wild canid), Canine; Loyalty, Companionship (archetype)**
Action::		**To act like a dog (loyal, playful, protective, pack-oriented); To follow faithfully**
Descriptor::	**Canine, Dog-like; Loyal, Faithful, Companionable**

> Represents members of the Canidae family, particularly the domestic dog. Derived conceptually from "inside" (*[[I]]*) the offspring/new (*[[NUKO]]*), suggesting a perpetually young-at-heart, dependent, or "inner-child" nature often associated with domestic dogs' relationship to humans, contrasting with the cat's (*[[NEKO]]*) independence. It also evokes the idea of being "inside" the family/pack.
