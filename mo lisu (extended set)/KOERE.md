# KOERE

IPA::				/ˈko.eɾe/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state of having characteristics typically associated with both male and female sexes (Intersex).**
Action::		**(Rarely used) To function biologically with mixed or intermediate sex characteristics.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biological characteristics typically associated with both male (*[[Kota]]*) and female (*[[Koi]]*) sexes, or characteristics intermediate between them (Intersex).**

> **Extended Set.** A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state where an individual's sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, chromosomal pattern, or hormonal patterns do not fit the typical definitions of solely male (*[[Kota]]*) or female (*[[Koi]]*). Derived from lifeform/body (*[[KO]]*) + pair/duality/reflection (*[[ERE]]*). This is a biological descriptor.

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)
*   Modifies a noun (*[[Ko]]*, *[[Ouman]]*, *[[Kopu]]*) to indicate the presence of intersex biological characteristics. Often requires *so* marker for clarity when acting purely descriptively, though predicate use with *o* is common.

Example::   *Le ouman se o **Koere**.* = "That person is biologically **intersex**."

Example::   *Sun **Koere** o sun ko hi.* = "Knowledge of **intersex biology** is knowledge of diverse life."

Example::   *Ko mu hat Kopu **Koere**.* = "Many lifeforms have **intersex body forms**."

Example::   *Le sipu **Koere** ro ko o mo.* = "The **intersex biological system** of the lifeform is complex."

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological category or state of being intersex. Often requires *le* marker.

Example::   *An toki ne **Koere**.* = "We talk about **intersex [biology]**."

Example::   *Le **Koere** o sun pene ne ko.* = "Understanding the **intersex state** is good knowledge within biology."

### Action
*   To biologically function or develop with intersex characteristics. Less common than descriptive use.

Example::   *I tilon pi, ko se kan **ta Koere**.* = "In its life cycle, that lifeform can **function with intersex characteristics**."

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **[[Koi]]** (*ko + i*): Descriptor for biological role associated with large gamete production.
*   **[[Kota]]** (*ko + ta*): Descriptor for biological role associated with small gamete production.
*   (Other biological descriptors: Koa, Kowai)
*   **[[Kopu]]** (*ko + pu*): The physical body form.
*   **[[Koipai]]** (*ko + i + pai*): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[ERE]]** (Pair, Duality, Reflection). Conceptually links the intersex state to the presence of a "pair" or "duality" of characteristics typically assigned separately to *Koi* and *Kota*.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Pai ro a kan o hi koere ro a.* = "One's identity can be different from one's intersex biology."

Proverb:: *Sipu ke o no sun koere.* = "Traditional systems often don't understand/recognize intersex biology."

Proverb:: *Koere o sun oum; Oum ko o pene.* = "Intersex biology is part of the spectrum of knowledge; All life is good/valid."
