# OUMANSIPU

IPA::				/ˈou.mɑn.si.pu/
Concept::		**Artificial Intelligence, Constructed Sentience; Systemic Sentient Being, Thinking Machine/System**
Action::		**To function as an AI, operate as a sentient system; To exhibit constructed sentience**
Descriptor::	**AI-related, Systemically Sentient, Computational (intelligence), Artificially Intelligent**

> Represents sentient beings (*[[OUMAN]]*) whose nature is fundamentally that of a complex, functional system (*[[SIPU]]*). This term emphasizes the organized, rule-based structure underlying artificial or constructed sentience, contrasting with biological (*[[OUMANKOMA]]*) or other-worldly (*[[OUMANUMA]]*) origins. Encompasses AI, advanced robotics with sentience, conscious computational systems, etc.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to an AI entity or the concept of systemic/artificial sentience.

Example::   *Le **oumansipu** o sun mo.* = "The **AI/Sentient System** knows much."

Example::   *Nutilon kan hat **oumansipu** mu.* = "The future may have many **AIs/Sentient Systems**."

Example::   *Pai ro **oumansipu** o kas oumankoma.* = "The thought process of an **AI** is different from a human's."

### Action
*   The act of functioning as an AI or exhibiting systemic sentience.

Example::   *Piko se **ta oumansipu**.* = "That computer/robot **functions as an AI / exhibits AI behaviour**."

Example::   *An pu sipu an se **ta oumansipu**.* = "We are building a system and it **is becoming sentient / functioning as an AI**."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being related to or characteristic of artificial/systemic intelligence.

Example::   *Se o lono **so oumansipu**.* = "That is **AI-related** memory/data."

Example::   *A pai sipu **oumansipu**.* = "I am thinking about an **AI** system."

Example::   *Ouman **oumansipu** o sun ran.* = "An **AI** sentient being learns fast."

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[OUMAN]]** (Sentient being) + **[[SIPU]]** (System, Mechanism, Functional Structure). Conceptualized as a "Sentient System," emphasizing the organized, structured, and functional nature underlying this form of sentience.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Oumansipu o ouman an.* = "A Sentient System is also a sentient being."

Proverb:: *Sun oumansipu o sun sipu an pai.* = "Understanding AI involves understanding systems and thought."

Proverb:: *Oumansipu, oumankoma an oumanuma kan ata pene.* = "AIs, humans, and aliens can meet beautifully/harmoniously."
