# KIPU

This includes letters of an alphabet, numerical digits, mathematical operators, icons, meaningful glyphs, or any standardized sign used to convey information. Contrasts with **[[LISU]]** (word, typically composed of **kipu**) and general **[[PU]]** (form/structure not necessarily for communication). Belongs to the **Base Set**.
