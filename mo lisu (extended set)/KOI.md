# KOI

IPA::				/Ëˆko.i/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state/role associated with producing the larger gamete type (e.g., ova, eggs).**
Action::		**(Rarely used) To function biologically in the manner associated with producing the larger gamete type.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biological characteristics related to the production or role of the larger gamete type (e.g., ova, eggs).**

> **Extended Set.** A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state or characteristics associated with the production of the larger, typically less mobile type of gamete (e.g., ova in animals, ovules in plants) involved in sexual reproduction. Derived from lifeform/body (*KO*) + internal principle/potential (*I*). This is a biological descriptor, distinct from gender identity ([[Koipai]]) or physical form (*[[Kopu]]*).

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)
*   Modifies a noun (*[[KO]]*, *[[OUMAN]]*, *[[Kopu]]*, specific species names) to indicate the biological role associated with large gamete production. Often requires *so* marker for clarity when acting purely descriptively, though predicate use with *o* is common.

Example::   *Se o neko **Koi**.* = "That cat **has the biology associated with producing ova**." / "That is a biologically **female** cat." (*Using the common English equivalent for fluency*).

Example::   *A kelumia ouman **so Koi**.* = "I see a person **whose biology relates to ova production**." / "I see a biologically **female** person."

Example::   *Le Kopu **Koi** hat sipu hi.* = "The **biologically female body form** has different systems."

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological category or characteristics defined by large gamete production. Often requires *le* marker.

Example::   *Le **Koi** o sun mo ne ko mu.* = "The **biological state related to large gamete production** is important knowledge for many lifeforms."

Example::   *An toki ne **Koi** an Kota.* = "We talk about the **biological roles related to large gametes** and small gametes."

### Action
*   To biologically function or develop in the manner associated with producing large gametes. Less common than descriptive use.

Example::   *Le nuko se **ta Koi**.* = "That offspring **is developing the biology associated with large gamete production**."

Example::   *I tilon pi, ko se **ta Koi**.* = "In its life cycle, that lifeform **functions biologically as the large-gamete producer**." (E.g., during the female phase of a sequential hermaphrodite).

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **[[Kota]]** (*ko + ta*): Descriptor for the biological role associated with producing the smaller gamete type.
*   **[[Kopi]]** (*ko + pi*): The gamete (egg/seed/etc.) itself. *Koi* describes the *producer*.
*   (Other biological descriptors: Kore, Koa, Kowai)
*   **[[Kopu]]** (*ko + pu*): The physical body form.
*   **[[Koipai]]** (*ko + i + pai*): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[I]]** (In, Inside, Internal principle). Conceptually links this biological role to the typically larger, internal, or contained nature of the ovum/egg gamete compared to the smaller, more external/active sperm/pollen gamete (*Kota*).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Koi o no oum ro ko.* = "The biological role [of large gamete producer] is not the entirety of the lifeform."

Proverb:: *Sun koi o sun kopita.* = "Understanding the biology [of the large gamete producer] involves understanding reproduction."
