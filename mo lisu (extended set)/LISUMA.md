## Usage

### Concept (Primary Use)
*   Refers to an individual item, record, or data point within a structured set.

Example::   *Tapelisu ro a hat **Lisuma** si ne.* = "My shopping list has nine **items/entries**."
Example::   *A kulumia **Lisuma** nu ne sipusunluno.* = "I see a new **record/entry** in the database."
Example::   *Oum **Lisuma** ne sunluno se o tao.* = "Every **entry** in that log is important."
Example::   *Se o **Lisuma** kas.* = "That is a different **item/entry**."

### Action
*   Often, the act of creating an entry is expressed using more specific verbs like *ta pu Lisuma* (to create/form an entry), *ta luno Lisuma* (to record an entry), or *ta kipu Lisuma* (to write/inscribe an entry). *Lisuma* itself can imply "to be an entry."

Example::   *Piko **ta pu Lisuma** nu.* = "The computer **creates** a new **entry/record**."
Example::   *Lisu se **Lisuma** ne Lisuluno.* = "That word **is an entry** in the dictionary." (predicate use)

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being an itemized part of a larger set, or relating to a specific entry.

Example::   *A na sun **so Lisuma**.* = "I need the **itemized/entry-specific** knowledge."
Example::   *Sipu se hat toki **Lisuma**.* = "That system has **itemized/entry-based** language/data."

## Compounds (Potential based on broader meaning)
*   **[[Lisumata]]** (*Lisuma* + *ta*): Logging, The act of making entries, Data entry (process).
*   **[[Lisumapi]]** (*Lisuma* + *pi*): Index (circular/ordered list of entries); Iteration over records.
*   **[[Lisumasun]]** (*Lisuma* + *sun*): Data Analysis, Record Interpretation ("entry knowledge").
*   **(Retained for Linguistics Special Set):** When *Lisuluno* (dictionary) is the context, *Lisuma* specifically means "dictionary entry."

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **LISU** (Word, Term, Label, Identifier) + **MA** (Earth, Land, Ground; *Foundation, Basis, Specific Point/Location, Material Embodiment*). Conceptualized as an "Identifier's Grounding/Specific Instance," "Label's Material Record," or "Term's Defined Place/Embodiment."

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Mu Lisuma li pu Lisuluno mo.* = "Many small entries/items create a large record/collection."

Proverb:: *Sun Lisuma o sun oum.* = "To understand the item/entry is to understand the whole (context)."

Proverb:: *A o lisuma i oumankoma* ="I am an entry in humanity."
