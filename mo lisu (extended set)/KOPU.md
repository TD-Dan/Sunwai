# KOPU

IPA::				/Ëˆko.pu/
Concept::		**Body Form, Physical Appearance, Physical Structure/Representation (of a lifeform)**
Action::		**To take physical form, manifest bodily**
Descriptor::	**Relating to the physical form/appearance of the body**

> **Extended Set.** Represents the physical form, structure, and appearance of a body (`[[KO]]`), distinct from its substance (`[[PE]]`), biological characteristics (`[[Koi]]`, `[[Kota]]`, etc.), or internal body image (`[[Koipai]]`). Derived from body (`KO`) + form/structure (`PU`).

## Usage

### Concept (Primary Use)
*   Refers to the tangible shape, structure, or visual representation of a body.

Example::   *Le **kopu** ro a o pene.* = "My **body form/physical appearance** is good."

Example::   *Neko hat **kopu** li.* = "The cat has a small **physical form/structure**."

Example::   *Le **kopu** ro sipu se o u.* = "The **physical structure** of that system (if biological) is chaotic."

Example::   *Pai ro **kopu** o no mo se pai ro koipai.* = "Thoughts about the **physical form** are not more important than thoughts about body image."

### Action
*   The act of a being or concept taking on a physical, bodily form.

Example::   *Sun **ta kopu** ne lisu.* = "Knowledge **takes form/manifests physically** in words/symbols." (Metaphorical)

Example::   *Ko se **kopu** mo.* = "That lifeform **manifests physically** as large."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something relating to the physical shape or structure of the body.

Example::   *A pai **so kopu**.* = "I have thoughts **relating to physical form**."

Example::   *Se o **kopu** pene.* = "That is a beautiful **physical form**."

*   Can be modified by biological descriptors:
    *   *E hat **kopu Koi**.* = "You have a **body form [with] female characteristics**."
    *   *Le ouman o hat **kopu Kota**.* = "The person has a **body form [with] male characteristics**."

## Related Concepts
*   [[Koipai]] (`ko + i + pai`): Body Image (internal perception of `kopu`).
*   [[Koi]] (`ko + i`): Descriptor for biological female characteristics.
*   [[Kota]] (`ko + ta`): Descriptor for biological male characteristics.
*   [[KOERE]] (`ko + re`): Descriptor for intersex biological characteristics.
*   [[Koa]] (`ko + a`): Descriptor for asexual/undifferentiated biology.
*   [[Kowai]] (`ko + wai`): Descriptor for biologically sex-fluid characteristics.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **[[KO]]** (Lifeform, Body) + **[[PU]]** (Form, Structure, Arrangement). Signifies "Body-Form."

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Kopu o no ko.* = "The physical form is not the (entire) lifeform/body." (Distinguishes appearance from the whole being).

Proverb:: *Kopu wai, usi ko wai.* = "The body's form flows/changes, if the lifeform flows/changes."

This entry establishes `Kopu`. The biological terms (`Koi`, `Kota`, etc.) remain as descriptors that modify `Kopu` or other relevant nouns, maintaining flexibility. This structure seems robust and clear.
