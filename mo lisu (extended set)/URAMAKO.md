## Origin

-   **Sunwai**: **[[U]]** + **[[RAN]]** + **[[MA]]** + **[[KO]]**.
    *   `U`: Represents chaos, uncertainty, rotation, interpreted here as the **skittishness, alertness, and unpredictable zig-zagging** movement typical of these animals when startled.
    *   `RAN`: Represents **speed, quickness, rapidity**, contributing the core aspect of their fast movement.
    *   `MA`: Represents **earth, ground, land**, indicating their terrestrial habitat.
    *   `KO`: Represents **lifeform, biological being**, classifying it within the animal kingdom.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Uramako ran o ke.* = "A fast rabbit is (still) alert/sensing." (Speed doesn't preclude caution).

Proverb:: *Ma sun tama ro utamako.* = "The earth knows the rabbit's path." (Nature has its ways; things leave traces).
