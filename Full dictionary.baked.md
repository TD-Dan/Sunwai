Okay, let's revise the dictionary entry for *SI*. The goal is to ensure its definition clearly encompasses the broader sense of "governing principle/law" alongside "measure/standard," particularly to support its role in *sipu*.

Here's the revised entry:

# SI

Marker::		**Numeral marker**
Concept::		**Rule, Law, Principle; Standard, Measure, Unit**
Action::		**To measure, quantify; To regulate (by rule), apply principles; To standardize**
Descriptor::	**Exact, Measured; Principled, Regulated**

> Represents systems of regulation, measurement, and underlying order. This includes not just quantifiable standards (*measure*, *unit*) but also the fundamental **principles, laws (natural or societal), or governing guidelines** (*rule*, *law*, *principle*) that structure behavior and interactions. It forms a core component of *sipu* (system = rule-based structure). Primary use is as a marker for numerals; other uses often require clarification (e.g., with *le* or *ta*).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Marks explicit numerical context to resolve ambiguity.

Example::   *A hat *si* a neko.* = "I have **one** cat." (vs. *A hat a neko* = "I have my cat.")

Example::   *Tama o *si* heim.* = "The road is **four**."

Example::   *E o *si* an ku?* = "Are you **two**?"

> More examples in [[Numerical context clarification]]

Example::   *Timo *ta si* ouman.* = "Time **governs/regulates** humanity." (Applies principle/law)

Example::   *An *ta si* ne sun se.* = "We **apply the principle** based on that knowledge."

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as conforming to a measurement, rule, or principle. Often requires *so*.

Example::   *Pu *so si* o mo.* = "The **regulated/measured** structure is big."

Example::   *Ta *so si* o pene.* = "A **principled/measured** action is good."

# NO

IPA::				/ˈno/
Marker::		**1. Not, No (Negation Particle)**
Marker::		**2. (Prefix) Reversal/Absence of Meaning**
Concept::		**(Derived) Negation, Opposition, Absence**
Action::		**(Derived) To negate, oppose, deny, make absent**
Descriptor::	**(Derived) Negative, Opposite, Absent**

> Fundamental root of negation, opposition, and absence. Primarily functions as a **Negation Particle** before the element it modifies, or as a **highly productive Prefix** attached to roots or compounds to create their semantic opposites or indicate absence. Understanding both roles is crucial.

## Usage

### Marker (1. Negation Particle - `no [X]`)
*   Placed immediately before a word, phrase, or clause to negate its meaning. This is a core grammatical function similar to English "not" or "no".

Example::   *A **no** tape.* = "I am **not** hungry."

Example::   *Se o **no** pene.* = "That is **not** beautiful."

Example::   ***No** an ta heim.* = "**Not** we go home." / "We do **not** go home."

Example::   *A hat **no** sun.* = "I have **no** knowledge." (Lit: "I have not knowledge.")

Example::   *E **no** kan ku?* = "You **can**not?"

### Marker (2. Prefix - Reversal/Absence of Meaning - `noX`)
*   A primary function of `NO` is to act as a **productive prefix** that reverses or negates the core meaning of the following root or compound word. This creates conceptual opposites, antonyms, or signifies the absence of the base concept.
*   This prefix applies broadly to concepts, actions, and descriptors where a logical opposite exists or absence is meaningful.
*   While some common and fundamental `no-` compounds have their own entries (e.g., `[[SENO]]`, `[[NOPENE]]`, `[[NOLONO]]`, `[[NOSUN]]`), this principle applies generally. Rely on context and the meaning of the base word to understand `no-` prefixed forms.

* *pene* ("beauty/good")  		-> ***nopene*** ("bad/ugly/disharmonious")
Example:: *Le **nopene** o u.* = "The **badness/ugliness** is chaos."

> Notice difference with previous *Se o no pene* -> "It is not beautiful" **vs.** *Se o nopene* = "It is ugly."

* *lono* ("memory/remember") 	-> ***nolono*** ("forgotten/unremembered")
Example:: *A lono, kas e **nolono** timo se.* = "I remember, but you **forget** that time." 

* *sun* ("clarity/knowledge") 	-> ***nosun*** ("nonknowledge/ignorance")
Example:: *Sun o lumia; **nosun** o senokulo.* = "Clarity is light; **ignorance** is blackness."

 * *kan* -> ("can/possible") 		-> ***nokan*** ("impossible/unable")
Example:: *Se o **nokan**.* = "That is **impossible**."

 * *an* ("togetherness")			-> ***noan*** ("separation")
Example:: *An o pene; **noan** o nopene.* = "Togetherness is good; **separation** is bad."

 *kune* -> ("touch/tangible") -> ***nokune*** = ("lack of tangibility")
Example:: *Wai o kune; ha o **nokune**.* = "Water is tangible; air is **intangible/untouchable**." 

* *ko* ("lifeform")				-> ***noko*** = ("absence of life")
Example::  *Lumia o ko; lu o **noko**.* = "Light is life-supporting; the void is **lifeless/without lifeforms**." 

 * *ta* ("action/change") 		->  ***nota*** ("lack of action/change")
Example::  *Ta o ko; so o **nota**.* = "Action/Change is life; stillness is **inaction/stasis**."


> **Pronunciation recommendation:** While the standard pronunciation is /no/, speakers should lenghten the vowel (/noː/) when NO is used as a prefix for added clarity or emphasis (e.g., nopene should be pronounced /ˈnoːpene/). This aligns with the standard stress pattern of lenghtening the first vowel of a word. This can of course be omitted if user prefers another stressing for any reason.

### Concept (Derived)
*   Refers to the concept of negation, opposition, or absence itself. Often requires `le`.

Example::   *Le **no** o mo i pai.* = "The concept of **negation/opposition** is significant in thought."
Example::   *A pai **no**.* = "I think about **absence/negation**."

### Action (Derived)

# NU

IPA::               /ˈnu/
Concept::       **Succession, That Which Comes After, The Next (in time, space, sequence), The Future**
Action::        **To follow, to succeed, to come after**
Descriptor::    **Following, Subsequent, Next, Coming, New (by implication)**

> Root indicating something that comes *after* something else in sequence, time, or spatial arrangement. Contrasts with *KE* (preceding). The *implication* of newness arises from something being subsequent to what exists, but the core meaning is relational succession.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to that which comes after, the next step, or the future in general.

Example::   *Le **nu** o u.* = "The **next (thing) / future** is uncertain." (*le* required to mark as Concept).

Example::   *A pai **nu**.* = "I think about **what comes next / the future**." (*nu* as Concept/Object).

Example::   *An pu **nu**.* = "We create the **future**." (Subject *an*, Verb *pu* implied, Object *nu*).

### Action
*   The act of following or succeeding something/someone.

Example::   *A **nu** e.* = "I **follow** you." (C-A-C flow; e.g., in line, or time).

Example::   *Le pai se **nu** le sun se.* = "That thought **follows** that knowledge." (C-A-C flow).

Example::   *Ko pene **nu** ko u.* = "Good lifeforms **follow** chaotic lifeforms." (e.g., in ecological succession).

### Descriptor
*   Describes something as being later in time, space, or sequence; subsequent or next. Can imply "new" through context.

Example::   *Se o pu **nu**.* = "That is the **following/subsequent/next** form." (Predicate Descriptor).

Example::   *Ouman **nu** ta toki.* = "The **next/following** person speaks." (*nu* modifies *ouman*).

Example::   *Le **nu nu** sun o u.* = "The **very next / far future** knowledge is uncertain." (Reduplication implying further succession).

### Temporal & Sequential Usage (as Descriptor)
*   Often used descriptively, frequently with the locative marker *ne*, to specify a subsequent time frame or sequence point.

Example::   *A hat tape **ne nu**.* = "I will have food (in the following time/moment)." (*nu* describes the temporal point marked by *ne*).

Example::   *E o **ne nu** ro a.* = "You are at the following position relative to me." / "You are after me (in sequence)." (*nu* describes the position marked by *ne*).

Example::   *Ne **nu** tilo, ouman ta nu ma.* = "In **following** time (lit. at following time), sentient beings will explore new lands." (*nu ma* = new lands).

## Compounds

-   **NUTILO** (*NU* + *TILO*): Future Time, The Future Era. Provides emphasis beyond *ne nu*.
-   **NUKO** (*NU* + *KO*): Offspring, New Generation ("following lifeform").
-   **[[NUHEIM]]** (*NU* + *HEIM*): New Settlement, Modern Dwelling ("following/next home").

## Origin

-   **Germanic**: Resonates with _new_, _neu_, _ny_. Core meaning shifted to sequence, but 'newness' remains a strong implication.
-   **Latin**: _novus_ ("new") and _sequor_ ("follow") provide conceptual links.
-   **Proto-Indo-European**: Roots like *\*neu̯os* ("new") often carried connotations of change and succession.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Pai nu, ta nu.* = "Think (about) the next (step), take the next (action)."
Okay, let's revise the dictionary entry for **SE** to incorporate its role as an optional marker for the consequent clause ("then") in conditional structures.

# SE

IPA::				/ˈse/
Marker::		**It, That, The (referential particle/pronoun)**
Marker::		**Than (comparative particle)**
Marker::		**Then (optional conditional consequence marker)**
Concept::		**Specificity, The Referenced Item/Instance, That Point**
Action::		**To specify, point out, refer to**
Descriptor::	**Specific, Particular, Said, Aforementioned**

> A highly versatile **Base Set** particle and root. Primarily functions as a **Marker**: a neutral pronoun referring to a specific entity/concept (**it, that, the**), the core particle for comparisons (**than**), and an optional marker introducing the consequence clause in conditionals (**then**). As a concept/action, it relates to the act or idea of **specifying or referencing**.

## Usage

### Marker (Referential Pronoun/Determiner)
*   Functions like a pronoun, referring to a previously established or contextually clear entity, concept, or situation. Gender-neutral. Can sometimes act like a definite article ("the specific one").

Example::   *Neko o pene. **Se** o li.* = "The cat is beautiful. **It** is small."

Example::   ***Se** o sun ro a.* = "**That is** my knowledge."

Example::   *A pai **se** lisu.* = "I think about **that/the specific** word."

### Marker (Comparative "than")
*   Used after the quality/descriptor in comparisons to introduce the standard being compared against.

Example::   *Neko o li inuko **se**.* = "The cat is smaller **than** the dog."

Example::   *Mo **se** e.* = "Bigger **than** you."

### Marker (Conditional Consequence "then" - Optional)
*   Optionally introduces the main clause (apodosis) in a conditional sentence, following a condition marked by *Usi*. It adds clarity, especially in spoken language.

Example::   *Usi a hat tape, **se** a pa ne e.* = "If I have food, **then** I give [it] to you."

Example::   *Usi tilo o pene, **se** an wai.* = "If the time is good, **then** we flow/go."

Example::   *Usi e sun, **se** toki.* = "If you understand, **then** speak." (Marker optional but adds flow).

### Concept
*   The idea of specificity, the exact item being discussed, or "that particular point/case." Often requires **le**.

Example::   *A pai le **se**.* = "I think about **that specific point/instance**."

Example::   *Le **se** ro toki o mo.* = "The **specificity/that exact point** of the speech is important."

### Action
*   The act of making something specific, pointing it out, or referring to it pointedly. Requires **ta**.

Example::   *A **ta se** le sun nu.* = "I **specify/refer to** the new knowledge."

Example::   ***Ta se** le lisu!* = "**Point out/Specify** the word!"

### Descriptor
*   Modifies a noun to mean "that specific one," "the particular one mentioned," or "aforementioned." Often requires **so**.

Example::   *A hat heim **so se**.* = "I have **that specific** home (we discussed)."

Example::   *Lisu **so se** o u.* = "**The aforementioned** word is uncertain."

## Compounds
*   **Seno** (**se** + **no**): Zero, nothingness ("that which is not," "the non-specific thing").

## Origin
*   **Wolof**: *ci* ("at, than") - Comparative inspiration.
*   **Japanese**: より (_yori_, "than") - Structural similarity in comparison.
*   **Latin**: _sē_ ("itself/themselves") - Reference inspiration.


## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Se o se.* = "That is that." / "It is specific."

Proverb:: *Usi sun, se ta.* = "If (there is) clarity/understanding, then act."
# SO
IPA::				/ˈso/
Marker::		**Descriptor marker (adjective/adverb)**
Concept::		**Stability, stillness, stasis, calm, balance (static)**
Action::		**To stabilize, to become still, to calm down, to remain unchanged**
Descriptor::	**Stable, still, static, calm, balanced (static)**

> Primarily an optional particle used to explicitly mark the following word as a descriptor (adjective/adverb). Secondarily, represents the concept of stability, stillness, or static balance, contrasting with TA (movement) and U (chaos).

## Usage

### Marker
*   Precedes a word to signal its function as a descriptor, modifying either a concept (noun) or an action (verb). *This is usually the default interpretation unless context strongly implies the 'Stability' meaning.*

Example::	***So** mo neko o pene.* = "The **big** cat is beautiful." - 'so' functions purely as a marker for 'mo'.

Example::	*A ta pai **so** pene.* = "I think **well / beautifully**." - 'so' functions purely as a marker for 'pene'.

### Concept
*   Refers to the state of being stable, unchanging, or calm.

Example::	*Le **so** o pene.* = "The **stillness/calm** is good." - 'le' marks 'so' as the concept noun.

Example::	*A pai **so**.* = "I think about **stability**." / "My thought is **stillness**."
- Ambiguous - could mean "I think calmly" (see Action/Descriptor).

### Action
*   The act of becoming or making stable or still.

Example::	*Wai **ta so**.* = "The water **becomes still / stabilizes**."

Example::	*A **ta so** le pai.* = "I **stabilize/calm** the mind."

### Descriptor
*   Describes a state of being stable, still, or calm. *Can sometimes overlap with Marker usage if 'so' is the descriptor being marked.*

Example::	*A o **so**.* = "I am **stable/still/calm**." - Here 'so' itself functions as the descriptor linked by 'o'.

Example::	*Sipu **so** o pene.* = "A **stable** system is good." - Here 'so' acts as an adjective describing 'sipu'.

Example::	*A hat **so so** pai.* = "I have a **very stable/calm** mind." - Reduplication for emphasis. `so` marks `so`.

## Compounds
- **[[SOHEIM]]** = Foundation, anchor point, safe haven (*so + heim* = "stable home/center")
- **[[SOTILO]]** = Period of calm, stasis (*so + tilo* = "still time")
- **[[SOWAI]]** = Still water, pool, calm liquid (*so + wai* = "still water")
- **[[SOKO]]** = Hibernation, dormancy, stable life state (*so + ko* = "still lifeform")

## Origin
- **English** _so_, _slow_, _stop_

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Ta so, so o.* = "To stabilize is to be."
Proverb:: *U no so, so no u.* = "Chaos is not stable, stability is not chaos."
Proverb:: *I so, sun wai.* = "In stillness, clarity/understanding flows."

Example::   *Le **ke ke** ouman o sun.* = "The **very ancient** (lit. preceding-preceding) person is wise."
Example::   *A hat tape **ne ke**.* = "I had food **before / in the past**." (`ne ke` = "at a preceding time").

## Compounds
> Compounds built on the past/precedence meaning.

*   [[Kelono]] (`KE` + `[[LONO]]`): History, Record of the Past ("preceding memory"). *(Formerly Kulono)*.
*   [[Keko]] (`KE` + `[[KO]]`): Elder, Ancestor ("preceding lifeform"). *(Formerly Kuko)*.
*   [[Kekulo]] (`KE` + `[[KULO]]`): Faded/Old color, Patina ("past/before color"). *(Formerly Kukulo)*.
*   Ketilo (`KE` + `[[TILO]]`): Past Time, Antiquity ("preceding time"). *(New, logical compound)*.
*   [[Kepu]] (`KE` + `[[PU]]`): Previous version, old model, archetype ("preceding form"). *(New, logical compound)*.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Meaning swapped with KU. Primarily gets this meaning systemically through the swap, allowing KU to align phonetically with U (Uncertainty) for its Question particle role. Direct phonetic resonance for "past/before" is less strong than for other roots, though distant conceptual links might be considered (e.g., English *keep* related to preserving the past, or the /k/ sound in sequence markers across languages).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Sun ke, o sun nu.* = "Knowing the precedent/past informs the following/future."
Proverb:: *Ke o tama ro lono.* = "The past is the road of memory."
Proverb:: *Ta ke o so.* = "To precede is to be stable (as a foundation for what follows)."

---

This defines `KE` in its new role. With `KU` and `KE` swapped and finalized, and `LO`/`MO`/`LI` defined, the core structural changes are set.

The next logical step would be to finalize `TILO` (Time), as it was directly affected by the `MO`->`LO` swap. Ready for `TILO`?

# ANSE

IPA::				/ˈan.se/
Marker::		**1. Additive/Inclusive Marker (also, too, as well, in addition, even)**
Marker::		**2. Similarity Marker (likewise, similarly)**
Marker::		**3. Emphasis Marker (and specifically this/that)**
Concept::		**(Rare/Derived) Addition, Inclusion, Similarity (as concepts)**

> Primarily functions as a versatile **Marker** indicating addition, inclusion, similarity, or emphasis. It connects elements, clauses, or ideas, signifying that something applies *in addition to* or *in a similar way as* something previously mentioned, or highlighting a *specific addition*. Derived from *AN* (And/Together) and *SE* (That Specific Thing/Instance).

## Usage

### Marker (Primary Role)
*   *ANSE* modifies the scope or application of statements, typically indicating addition, similarity, or emphasis. Its placement influences the nuance.

*   **Indicating Addition/Inclusion (also, too, as well, in addition):** Signals that the marked element or clause is added to a previously established context.
    Example:: *A o pene. E **anse**.* = "I am good. You **also/too**." (Marks 'E' as included in the state 'pene').
    Example:: *A hat neko an inuko **anse**.* = "I have a cat and a dog **as well**." (Marks 'inuko' as an addition to what 'A' has).
    Example:: ***Anse**, an toki pai.* = "**In addition / Furthermore**, we talk about play/thought." (Marks the entire clause as an addition).

*   **Indicating Similarity (likewise, similarly):** Shows that an action or state described also applies to the marked element, or that an action is performed in a similar manner.
    Example:: *A ta heim. E **anse**.* = "I am going home. You **likewise / are doing so too**." (Marks 'E' as sharing the action 'ta heim').
    Example:: *Neko o pai. Inuko **anse**.* = "The cat is playful. The dog **similarly** (is playful)." (Marks 'Inuko' as sharing the quality 'pai', predicate often omitted if identical).

*   **Emphasizing Specific Addition (and specifically that, even):** Draws attention to an item being included, sometimes unexpectedly.
    Example:: *A kulumia oum ko: neko, inuko, **anse** uramako!* = "I saw all the animals: the cat, the dog, **and even / and specifically** the rabbit!" (Marks 'uramako' as a specific, perhaps notable, addition).
    Example:: ***Anse** neko li kan tape wahiko mo.* = "**Even** the small cat can eat the big duck." (Marks 'neko li' with emphatic inclusion in the possibility).

*   **Placement Notes:** Generally placed near the element being added/emphasized (often after a noun/pronoun) or at the beginning of an added clause. Flexibility allows for nuance.

### Concept (Rare/Derived)
*   (Rarely used directly as a noun). Refers abstractly to the idea of addition, inclusion, or similarity itself. Requires *le*.
    Example:: *Le **anse** ne pai o mo.* = "The **concept of addition/similarity** in thought is significant."

### Action / Descriptor
*   (*ANSE* does not function as an Action or Descriptor in the typical sense).

## Compounds
*   *(None typically formed from this particle)*

## Origin
*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **AN** (And, Together, We) + **SE** (It, That, The specific thing/instance). Conceptualized as "And That Specifically" or "Together With That Specific Thing," applied broadly to mark addition, inclusion, and similarity.

# KOTA

IPA::				/ˈko.tɑ/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state/role associated with producing the smaller gamete type (e.g., sperm, pollen).**
Action::		**(Rarely used) To function biologically in the manner associated with producing the smaller gamete type.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biological characteristics related to the production or role of the smaller gamete type (e.g., sperm, pollen).**

> **Extended Set.** A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state or characteristics associated with the production of the smaller, typically more mobile type of gamete (e.g., sperm in animals, pollen in plants) involved in sexual reproduction. Derived from lifeform/body (`KO`) + external principle/action (`TA`). This is a biological descriptor, distinct from gender identity or physical form (`[[Kopu]]`).

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)
*   Modifies a noun (`[[Ko]]`, `[[Ouman]]`, `[[Kopu]]`, specific species names) to indicate the biological role associated with small gamete production. Often requires `so` marker for clarity when acting purely descriptively, though predicate use with `o` is common.

Example::   *Se o inuko **Kota**.* = "That dog **has the biology associated with producing sperm**." / "That is a biologically **male** dog." (*Using common English equivalent*).

Example::   *A kelumia ouman **so Kota**.* = "I see a person **whose biology relates to sperm production**." / "I see a biologically **male** person."

Example::   *Le Kopu **Kota** hat Kopi hi.* = "The **biologically male body form** has different gametes." (Lit: ...has different eggs/seeds - maybe phrase differently: *hat sipu Kopi hi* - different gamete system). *Revision: Le Kopu Kota hat Kopi Kota.* "The biologically male body form has male gametes."

Example::   *Le sipu **Kota** o hi.* = "The **biologically male system** is different."

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological category or characteristics defined by small gamete production. Often requires `le` marker.

Example::   *Le **Kota** o sun mo ne ko mu.* = "The **biological state related to small gamete production** is important knowledge for many lifeforms."

Example::   *An toki ne Koi an **Kota**.* = "We talk about the **biological roles related to large gametes** and **small gametes**."

### Action
*   To biologically function or develop in the manner associated with producing small gametes. Less common than descriptive use.

Example::   *Le nuko se **ta Kota**.* = "That offspring **is developing the biology associated with small gamete production**."

Example::   *I tilo pi, ko se **ta Kota**.* = "In its life cycle, that lifeform **functions biologically as the small-gamete producer**." (E.g., during the male phase of a sequential hermaphrodite).

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **Koi** (`ko + i`): Descriptor for the biological role associated with producing the larger gamete type.
*   **Kopi** (`ko + pi`): The gamete (egg/seed/sperm/pollen) itself. `Kota` describes the *producer* of the smaller type.
*   (Other biological descriptors: Kore, Koa, Kowai)
*   **Kopu** (`ko + pu`): The physical body form.
*   **Koipai** (`ko + i + pai`): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **KO** (Lifeform, Body) + **TA** (Action, Change, Process, External principle). Conceptually links this biological role to the typically smaller, more mobile, active, or externally delivered nature of the sperm/pollen gamete compared to the larger, more internal/contained ovum/egg gamete (`Koi`).

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Kota o no oum ro ko.* = "The biological role [of small gamete producer] is not the entirety of the lifeform."

Proverb:: *Sun Kota o sun kopita.* = "Understanding the biology [of the small gamete producer] involves understanding reproduction."

IPA::				/ˈko.ɾe/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state of having characteristics typically associated with both male and female sexes (Intersex).**
Action::		**(Rarely used) To function biologically with mixed or intermediate sex characteristics.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biological characteristics typically associated with both male (`[[Kota]]`) and female (`[[Koi]]`) sexes, or characteristics intermediate between them (Intersex).**

> **Extended Set.** A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state where an individual's sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, chromosomal pattern, or hormonal patterns do not fit the typical definitions of solely male (`[[Kota]]`) or female (`[[Koi]]`). Derived from lifeform/body (`KO`) + pair/duality/reflection (`RE`). This is a biological descriptor.

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)

*   **Koipai** (`ko + i + pai`): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **KO** (Lifeform, Body) + **RE** (Pair, Duality, Reflection). Conceptually links the intersex state to the presence of a "pair" or "duality" of characteristics typically assigned separately to `Koi` and `Kota`.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Pai ro a kan o hi kore ro a.* = "One's identity can be different from one's intersex biology."

Proverb:: *Sipu ke o no sun kore.* = "Traditional systems often don't understand/recognize intersex biology."

Proverb:: *Kopu wai, usi ko wai.* = "The body's form flows/changes, if the lifeform flows/changes."

---
This entry establishes `Kopu`. The biological terms (`Koi`, `Kota`, etc.) remain as descriptors that modify `Kopu` or other relevant nouns, maintaining flexibility. This structure seems robust and clear.
Okay, here is the draft dictionary entry for *Kopita*.

---

# KOPITA

IPA::				/ˈko.pi.tɑ/
Concept::		**Reproduction (Biological Act), Procreation, Mating, Pollination**
Action::		**To reproduce biologically, procreate, mate, pollinate**
Descriptor::	**Reproductive, Procreative (relating to the biological act)**

> **Extended Set.** Represents the biological action involving the creation or joining of gametes/seeds (*Kopi*) to produce new offspring. This term focuses on the biological *function* of reproduction across different lifeforms (e.g., mating, spawning, pollination) and is distinct from acts of physical intimacy (*Koan*).

## Usage

### Concept

Example::   *An sun sipu **so Kopita** ro kohi.* = "We understand the **reproductive** system of the bird."

Example::   *Tilo se o **Kopita**.* = "That time is **reproductive** (e.g., a mating season)."

## Related Concepts / Distinctions
*   **Kopi** (*ko + pi*): The egg, seed, spore, or gamete involved in *kopita*.
*   **Nuko** (*nu + ko*): The newborn/offspring resulting from successful *kopita*.
*   **Koan** (*ko + an*): Intimate Bodily Togetherness/Connection. *kopita* is about biological function, *koan* is about physical closeness/connection. They may co-occur but are distinct concepts.
    *   *Example Distinction:* *Usi ko re ta koan so napai, se kan ta kopita.* = "If two lifeforms are sexually intimate, they might reproduce."

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **Kopi** (Egg, Seed, Gamete) + **TA** (Action, Change, Process). Signifies "Egg/Seed Action," directly referencing the biological units and the action involved in reproduction.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Kopita o ta ro ko.* = "Reproduction is the action of life."

Proverb:: *Pi ro Kopita o pi ro oum ko.* = "The cycle of reproduction is the cycle of all life."

Proverb:: *Kopita o no koan, kas kan o ata.* = "Reproduction is not (the same as) intimacy, but they can meet/occur together."

# KOPI

IPA::				/ˈko.pi/
Concept::		**Egg, Seed, Spore, Gamete; Biological Starting Unit**
Action::		**(Rarely used directly; see Usage)**

> **Extended Set.** Represents the self-contained biological unit from which a new lifeform cycle begins, such as an egg, seed, spore, or gamete. Derived from lifeform (*KO*) and circle/cycle (*PI*). Primarily functions as a noun.

## Usage

### Concept (Primary Use)
*   Refers to the biological starting unit itself. It is typically used as a noun (the subject or object of a sentence) or in combination with other words to express specific relationships.

Example::   *Le **kopi** o li.* = "The **egg/seed** is small."

Example::   *Oum ko nu ro **kopi**.* = "All life is new from an **egg/seed/spore**."

Example::   *A kelumia **Kopi** mu.* = "I see many **eggs/seeds**."

### Expressing Relationships with *Kopi*
*   **Production:** Use *pu kopi* ("to make/form Kopi").
    *   Example:: *Kohi mama **pu kopi** ne heim.* = "The mother bird **produces/lays eggs** in the nest."
    *   Example:: *Lumako **pu kopi** pi tilo.* = "The plant **produces seeds** cyclically."
*   **Containing:** Use *hat kopi* ("to have Kopi") or *pu hat Kopi* ("structure having Kopi").
    *   Example:: *Pu se **hat kopi**.* = "That structure (e.g., seed pod, ovary) **contains seeds/eggs**."
*   **Developing From:** Use phrases like *nu ro kopi* ("new from Kopi") or the specific compound *[[Kopiko]]*.
    *   Example:: *Nuko o ko **nu ro kopi**.* = "The offspring is the lifeform **new from the egg/seed**."

### Action
*   Direct use as a verb (*ta kopi*) is highly uncommon and potentially unclear. Actions related to *kopi* (laying, producing, planting) are better expressed using verbs like *pu* (make/form) or context-specific verbs if developed (e.g., a verb for "plant seed").

### Descriptor
*   Using *kopi* directly as an adjective (*so kopi*) is generally avoided as it lacks specific meaning. To describe qualities *associated* with eggs/seeds (e.g., potential, roundness, newness), use other relevant roots like *Lu*, *Pi*, or *Nu*. To describe something *related to the function* of *kopi*, compound nouns (*Kopiheim*, *Kopita*) or descriptive phrases are clearer.

## Related Concepts
*   **Kopita** (*Kopi + ta*): The biological act of reproduction involving *Kopi*.
*   **Nuko** (*nu + ko*): The newborn/offspring that develops from *Kopi*.
*   **[[Kopiko]]** (*Kopi + ko*): Embryo, Larva ("egg/seed lifeform").

## Compounds
*   **[[Kopiheim]]** (*Kopi + heim*): Nest, Seed bank, Incubator ("egg/seed home").

# KOAN

IPA::				/ˈko.an/
Concept::		**Intimate Bodily Togetherness/Connection; Physical Closeness (e.g., holding, cuddling, nuzzling, grooming)**
Action::		**To be physically close/connected/intimate; To cuddle, hold, nuzzle** (*ta Koan*)
Descriptor::	**Physically Intimate/Close/Connected**

> **Extended Set.** Represents a state or act of close, often affectionate, physical connection and togetherness between lifeforms (*KO* + *AN*). The meaning centers on general physical intimacy like holding, cuddling, nuzzling, grooming, or huddling for warmth. It does **not** inherently refer to sexual activity.

## Usage

### Concept
*   Refers to the state or concept of close physical connection.

Example::   *Le **Koan** ro mama an nuko o pene.* = "The **physical closeness/connection** between the parent and offspring is beautiful/good."

Example::   *Mu ko na **Koan** ne eistilo.* = "Many lifeforms need **bodily togetherness** (e.g., huddling) in the cold season."

Example::   *Le **Koan** i oumanan o mo.* = "The **physical closeness** within the partnership is significant."

### Action
*   Engaging in acts of physical closeness or intimacy. Requires *ta* marker for clarity as a verb.

Example::   *Neko re **ta Koan**.* = "The two cats **are physically close / cuddling**."

Example::   *An **ta Koan**.* = "We **are physically close / cuddle**." (Default reading is non-sexual closeness).

Example::   *Mamapi an nuko **ta Koan**.* = "The parent and offspring **cuddle / are physically close**."

### Descriptor
*   Describes a situation or relationship characterized by physical closeness/intimacy. Often requires *so* marker.

Example::   *An hat pai **so Koan**.* = "We have an **intimate (physically close)** relationship/thought."

Example::   *Se o tilo **so Koan**.* = "That is a time of **physical closeness/intimacy**."

**Usage Note on Expressing Sexual Intimacy:**
*Koan* itself does not mean "sex". To specifically describe physical intimacy that *is* sexual in nature, one must use descriptive phrases involving *[[Napai]]* (Sexuality/Desire-Mind) or rely on strong contextual cues. The phrase ***ta Koan so Napai*** ("to be physically close/intimate in a sexual manner") explicitly denotes sexual intimacy involving connection. For the biological act of reproduction, use *Kopita*.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **KO** (Lifeform, Body) + **AN** (Together, And, We). Conceptualizes intimacy as "Body Togetherness." Definition explicitly focuses on non-sexual physical closeness and connection.

## Proverbs

Proverb:: *Koan o heim ro ko.* = "Physical closeness is a home for the body." (Implies comfort, safety).

Proverb:: *I Koan pene, pai pene.* = "In good/harmonious physical connection, the mind/experience is good/harmonious."

IPA::				/ˈko.wɑi/
Concept::		**(Generally used as Descriptor) The biological state of changing sex characteristics over time (Sequential Hermaphroditism) or having fluid sex characteristics.**
Action::		**To change biological sex characteristics over time.**
Descriptor::	**Exhibiting biologically fluid or changing sex characteristics (Sex-Fluid).**

> A descriptor primarily used to denote the biological state where an individual lifeform can change its primary sex characteristics or functions (e.g., from male to female or vice-versa) during its lifespan, or exhibits fluidity in these characteristics. Derived from lifeform/body (`KO`) + flow/change (`WAI`). This is a biological descriptor.

## Usage

### Descriptor (Primary Use)
*   Modifies a noun (`[[Ko]]`, `[[Ouman]]`, `[[Kopu]]`, specific species names) to indicate biologically fluid or changing sex characteristics. Often requires `so` marker for clarity when acting purely descriptively, though predicate use with `o` is common.

Example::   *Waiko mu o **kowai**.* = "Many fish are biologically **sex-fluid**."

Example::   *Le sipu ro ko se o **kowai**.* = "The biology of that lifeform is **sex-fluid**."

Example::   *Se o Kopu **so kowai**.* = "That is a **biologically fluid body form**."

### Concept
*   Refers to the biological phenomenon of sex fluidity or change. Often requires `le` marker.

Example::   *Le **kowai** o sun hi ne ko.* = "Biological **sex-fluidity** is interesting knowledge in lifeforms."

Example::   *An sun **kowai** ne waiko pi.* = "We understand **sex-fluidity** in some fish."

### Action
*   To undergo a biological change in sex characteristics. Requires `ta` marker.

*   **Kota** (`ko + ta`): Descriptor for biological male characteristics (can be a stage for a `Kowai` being).
*   (Other biological descriptors: Kore, Koa)
*   **Kopu** (`ko + pu`): The physical body form (can change in a `Kowai` being).
*   **Koipai** (`ko + i + pai`): Body image.

## Origin

*   **Sunwai**: Compound of **KO** (Lifeform, Body) + **WAI** (Flow, Change, Liquid). Conceptually links this biological state to the idea of sex characteristics "flowing" or "changing" over time.
